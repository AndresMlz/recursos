%
% It's another lazy day at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.  Homer
% sits snoring at his desk, his old, faithful dog snoozing in a chair
% next to him.  Lenny has craftily constructed a hammock for himself in
% another room.
%
% In his sleep, Homer rests his head on the control panel in front of
% him -- directly on the "PLANT DESTRUCT: PLEASE DO NOT PUSH" button.
% The control room becomes awash in the red glow of emergency lights,
% and the automated female voice says, "Core meltdown in ten seconds...
% nine..." Homer's dog wakes up, hears the voice, and pulls the reset
% lever with his mouth.  The voice announces, "Meltdown averted...good
% boy."
%
% Mr. Burns, too, is asleep in his chair, its back to his wall of
% monitors.  Yes, even the people on the monitors are asleep too.
% Smithers sleeps, curled up beside Burns' chair.  His leg twitches, and
% he moans softly in his sleep.
%
% Outside, in the parking lot, the Nuclear Inspection Van recreational
% vehicle pulls up.  Three white hard-hatted, lab-jacketed inspectors
% jump out and press the buzzer at the entrance to the plant.

Agent 1: [presses the buzzer]
  Burns: [awakening, over the intercom] Mmm...hmm...what?  How dare you
         disturb me during nap time.
Agent 1: We're from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  This is a
         surprise test of worker competence.
  Burns: There must be some mistake.  We, er, we make cookies here: Mr.
         Burns' Olde-Fashioned Good-Time Extra-Chewy --
Agent 2: [to Agent 3] Get the axe.
-- We've done this before, "Homer Goes to College"

% Smithers and Burns watch from the window as the inspectors lead some
% plant employees into their vehicle.

   Burns: The watchdog of public safety...is there any lower form of
          life?
Smithers: Don't worry sir, I rounded up our less gifted employees and
          led them into the basement.
           [Shot of the basement with Homer and two other guys]
  Bernie: Duh, Homer, why are we down here?
   Homer: Aw, geez.  I told you, Bernie: to guard the bee!
     Man: [whining] But why?
   Homer: Aw, you guys are pathetic.  No wonder Smithers made me head
          bee-guy.
           [Homer kicks the jar accidentally, smashing it, and the bee
          escapes]
  Bernie: Duh, he's gettin' away.
     Man: Oh, we did bad!
-- No recess for you, "Homer Goes to College"

% The inspectors want to test Homer's competence next, but Smithers
% apologizes for him, saying, "He couldn't _bee_ here."  Burns fobs them
% off with some excuse about Homer chairing a conference on nuclear
% fission in Geneva.  Unfortunately, Homer jumps up through a manhole
% cover just then, exclaiming, "The bee bit my bottom!  Now my bottom's
% big!"
%
% The inspectors put Homer in the van.

Agent 2: Homer, this is an exact replica of your work station.
  Homer: [moans]
Agent 2: Now we're going to simulate a power surge in core sector eight.
  Homer: What the hell are you talking about?
-- This won't look good on a resume, "Homer Goes to College"

% Homer is despondent.

  Homer: What do I do?  What do I do?  In the name of God you've got to
         tell me!  [sobbing]
Agent 2: Relax, it's just a simulator.  Nothing can go wrong.
  Homer: [sotto voce] Just poke blindly at the controls until they let
         you go.
-- It's worked before, "Homer Goes to College"

% Homer begins doing just that, but something goes horribly wrong.
% "This can't be happening!" exclaims one of the inspectors, as the van
% begins to glow green and sink into the ground.  Panic ensues at the
% plant.  Burns decides to try to get away in his escape pod.  He
% activates the entrance to the pod, jumps in, and slams the door shut.
% Smithers implores, "For the love of God, sir, there are two seats!"
% but Burns likes to put his feet up.  The pod takes off, but doesn't
% even come close to reaching escape velocity.  Instead, it crashes into
% the street and continues bouncing down it in a crumpled ball.
%
% A glowing green Homer rises out of the hole left where the van used to
% be, growling and fearsome.  "Must destroy mankind," he intones, but
% the alarm on his watch goes off, reminding him that it's lunch time.
% He shakes off his radioactivity and bounds off to eat.
%
% The agents watch the detox team spray the hole in the parking lot with
% a foamy sealant.

Agent 2: I'm still not sure how he caused the meltdown.  There wasn't
         any nuclear material in the truck!
  Burns: Oh, very well, it's time for your bribe.
         Now, you can either have the washer and dryer where the lovely
         Smithers is standing, or you can trade it all in for what's in
         this box.
-- I can't decide, Monty, "Homer Goes to College"

% One inspector wants the box, but the other inspector remembers her
% ethics.  She explains that Burns can't make the problem go away just
% by throwing money at it, but just then, Mayor Quimby walks by in a fur
% coat labeled "$5000" saying that he he's decided there will be no
% investigation.  He then leaves.
%
% The inspectors tell Burns that Homer's job requires college training
% in nuclear physics.  If he doesn't get Homer up to speed, they tell
% him, they'll be forced to take legal action.  "Is that so?" asks
% Burns.  "I have the feeling you'll be dropping the charges," he says,
% emphasizing "dropping" as he pushes a red button on his desk.  A trap
% door springs open, but it's nowhere near where the inspectors are
% standing.  "The painters moved your desk," Smithers reminds him.
%
% The doorbell rings at the Simpsons house, and Homer goes to answer it.

 Homer: [answers the door, sees Burns with his lawyers] Aah!
 Burns: Hello, Simpson.  My lawyers and I were in the neighborhood and
        thought we'd stop by.
 Marge: [nervously] Would you like to come in for tea and marshmallow
        squares?
         [The lawyers discuss it quietly amongst themselves]
Lawyer: Yes, he would.
-- Executive decision, "Homer Goes to College"

% At the table, Homer asks Burns to confirm that he must go to college.
% Bart scoffs, asking Homer, "College?  Barber or Clown?"

   Burns: Remember, your job and the future of your family hinges on
          your successful completion of Nuclear Physics 101.
          Oh, and one more thing: [ominously] you must find the jade
          monkey before the next full moon.
Smithers: Actually sir, we found the jade monkey; it was in your glove
          compartment.
   Burns: And the road maps?  And ice scraper?
Smithers: They were in there too, sir.
   Burns: Ex-cellent!  It's all falling into place.
-- Now as long as there are no meddling kids..., "Homer Goes to College"

% That night, in bed, Marge expresses her support for the idea of Homer
% going to college.  "You could learn so much," she thinks.  "Maybe
% you're right," says Homer, "I did always want to go to college, {but
% fate stood in the way."  He thinks back to high school, where his
% guidance counselor tried to get him to sign an application, assuring
% him, "You're a shoe-in," but Homer gets distracted by a dog with a ham
% outside.  Sighing, the counselor throws Homer's application away.}
%
% {Back in the present, Homer is filling out college applications.  His
% garbage bin is full of crumpled paper.}

Homer: [growls in frustration]
 Lisa: Dad, don't let these application essays throw you.  Let's see:
       "List your three favorite books and how they've influenced your
       life."
Homer: Is "TV Guide" a book?
 Lisa: No.
Homer: "Son of Sniglet"?
 Lisa: No.
Homer: Katherine Hepburn's "Me"?
 Lisa: No!
Homer: Oh, I suck.
-- "Reading Digest" counts, though, "Homer Goes to College"

% Homer slaves away at the applications.

Homer: [writing] "...It was the most I ever threw up, and it changed my
       life forever."
 Bart: You the man, Homer!
Homer: Thanks, boy!
-- What it is, "Homer Goes to College"

% For the crowning touch, Homer pastes his photo to the application.
% The one he chooses shows him cramming a birthday cake into his mouth,
% as Marge looks on worriedly.

 Bart: I dunno, Dad: don't you have a better picture?
Homer: Relax.  A photo can't make any difference.
        [A man and a woman review applications, and they come across
       Homer's]
  Man: [looking at the photo] He looks crazy.
Woman: Agreed.  Reading his essay would only waste valuable seconds.
-- Next!, "Homer Goes to College"

% Bart watches TV at home.

Finally!  The great taste of Worcestershire Sauce in a soft drink.
Ah..."Steakie"!
-- A TV commercial, "Homer Goes to College"

% Homer walks in and preempts Bart's program for a show about college
% that he really should watch.  The show is called "School of Hard
% Knockers", and it stars Corey Masterson.

 Prez: [on TV] Dean Bitterman, I hope nothing unsavory happens during my
       visit.  As you know, I _am_ the President of the United States.
 Dean: Oh, don't worry.  I've expelled those rowdy members of Chugalug
       house.
Homer: [watching] Ohh, I hate that lousy Dean!
Corey: [on TV] Your Bra Bomb better work, Nerdlinger!
 Nerd: Hey!
        [Corey presses the plunger; an explosion occurs in the
       background]
        [Many colors of bras rain down on the Dean and the President]
 Dean: Corey?!  Don't worry, Mr. President, I --
        [looks over, sees the President dancing and enjoying himself]
       Mr. President!
 Prez: Lighten up, Bitterman...that youngster will make a perfect
       addition to my cabinet.  Secretary of Partying Down!
 Dean: [growls; a bra falls on his head]
Homer: [triumphant] Yes!  Take _that_, Bitterman.
-- College is _just_ like that, "Homer Goes to College"

% Marge brings in the mail: it has the decision letters from all the
% colleges Homer applied to.  Sadly, none of them are letters of
% acceptance.

 Bart: Well, Pop, what are you going to do?
Homer: [resolutely] Something I should have done a _long_ time ago.
        [long pause]
Marge: You don't know, do you?
Homer: [meekly] No, ma'am.
-- Homer's empty life, "Homer Goes to College"

% Burns thinks he has a solution.  He wants to use his power at
% Springfield University, where he holds a chair.  But the meeting is
% more difficult than he has foreseen.

  Man: I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but I must object.  This Simpson is not
       qualified!
        [There are nods of agreement]
Burns: I see.  Well, you know, fellows, I look at the admissions board a
       lot like a baseball team.  You all like baseball, don't you?
        [Everyone assents]
       Yes, well, to have a successful baseball club, you need teamwork,
       [Smithers hands him a baseball bat] not some hot-dog admissions
       officer playing by his own rules!
        [Burns starts hitting the man in the head with almost no force]
  Man: [noticing] Er, excuse me, what are you doing?
Burns: I'm giving you the [grunt] beating of your life!
  Man: Look, if -- stop that!  -- you wanted him that badly, why didn't
       you just say so?
Burns: [collapses from exertion] Smithers, dismember the corpse and send
       his widow a corsage.
-- "Homer Goes to College"

% Homer is elated: Burns' tactic worked!

Homer: Woo-hoo!  I'm a college man!  I won't need my high school diploma
       any more!  [sets fire to it and starts singing]
       I am so smart!
       I am so smart!
       I am so smart!
       I am so smart!
       S-M-R-T!
       I mean, S-M-A-R-T...
-- You were saying?, "Homer Goes to College"

% The fire Homer sets quickly engulfs the diploma and begins spreading
% to the wall.
%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 8:07]
%
% At last, it's...

Homer: My first day of college.  I wish my father was alive to see this.
  Abe: [springing up from the back seat] Hey!
Homer: How long have you been back there?
  Abe: [meekly] Three days!
-- That explains the smell, "Homer Goes to College"

% Marge parks the car in the parking lot, and as she does, Homer sees a
% nerd walk by.

Homer: [yelling at a student] Neeeerd!
Marge: Homer, that isn't very nice.
Homer: Marge, try to understand.  There are two kinds of college
       students: jocks and nerds.  As a jock, it is my duty to give
       nerds a hard time.
        [A "jock" walks by]
       Hey pal!  Did you get a load of the nerd?
 Jock: [not understanding] Pardon me?
-- The times, they are a-changin', "Homer Goes to College"

% To meet some new friends, Homer takes Marge to the Freshman Mixer.
% Glancing around, Homer sees a bowl of punch, and decides to help is
% popularity.

  Homer: [spiking the punch] Heh heh, I'll be a campus hero.
          [Another student tastes the punch and spits it out]
Student: Attention, everyone: the punch has been spiked.
          [Everyone gasps]
         Don't worry.  Your parents have been called and will be here to
         pick you up shortly!
          [Everyone cheers]
-- Let's try plan two, "Homer Goes to College"

Homer: Marge, someone squeezed all the life out of these kids.  And
       unless movies and TV have lied to me, it's a crusty, bitter old
       Dean!
 Dean: Hi there!  Hello, I'm Dean Peterson, but you can call me Bobby.
       I just want you to know if you ever feel stressed out from
       studying or whatever, I'm always up for some hackey sack.  Or,
       hey!  If you just want to come by and jam, I used to be the bass
       player for the Pretenders.  [plays a riff]
Homer: [bitterly] Boy, I can't wait to take some of the starch out of
       that stuffed shirt.
-- Character evaluation problems, "Homer Goes to College"

% On the first day of class, Homer sits at the back of the lecture hall.
% The lecturer is an older man in a white lab coat, and he speaks with a
% germanic accent.  "I see a lot of new faces," he says, "but, you know
% the old saying: out with the old, in with the nucleus."  Everyone
% laughs except Homer.  When the lecturer drops his cue cards by
% mistake, Homer's mirth seems to know no bounds.  None of the other
% students see what he finds so funny.

 Prof: {Now if anyone would like to stay, I'm going to hold a
       comprehensive review session after every class.}
Homer: {[waving] Do we have to?}
 Prof: {No --}
Homer: {Then kiss my curvy butt goood-bye!}
-- "Homer Goes to College"

% {Homer opts for chasing around a pair of squirrels with a stick
% instead of staying for the (no doubt much needed) review session.}
%
% {At home, Homer has altered his room to be more like that of a college
% student.  He has posters of W. C. Fields, Einstein, and a ballerina's
% feet on the wall, and he's made a makeshift bookshelf from four planks
% and six cinderblocks.  He's listening to "Louie, Louie" on his
% stereo.}

 Marge: {Homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase.}
 Homer: {Yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus.  Besides, it
        isn't costing us: I swiped the cinderblocks from a construction
        site.
         [At the site, a worker walks forlorn up to his boss]}
Worker: {Sir, six cinderblocks are missing.}
  Boss: {There'll be no hospital, then.  I'll tell the children.}
-- "Homer Goes to College"

% Back in Nuclear Physics 101, the professor explains a high-tech piece
% of equipment to the class.

 Prof: This proton accelerator destabilizes the atom in this chamber
       here, then propels it --
Homer: Uh, excuse me, Professor Brainiac, but I worked in a nuclear
       power plant for ten years, and, uh, I think I know how a proton
       accelerator works.
 Prof: Well, please, come down and show us.
Homer: All right, I will.
        [Everyone abandons the glowing green building]
        [Homer walks out, glowing green himself]
Homer: [to meltdown men] In there, guys.
  Men: Thanks, Homer.
-- If I didn't know better, I _might_ think you'd met him before, "Homer
    Goes to College"

% The Dean is kind to Homer, despite the egregious nature of his screw-
% up.

 Dean: Homer, no one blames you for the accident, we simply feel you
       might benefit from outside tutoring.  I researched these names
       myself.  [hands him a list]
Homer: [to himself] Yeah, you've won this round, Dean...but the war
       isn't over.  [exits]
        [Dean's phone rings]
 Dean: Hello?
Homer: [disguising his voice] Hello, Dean!  You're a stupid-head.
 Dean: Homer, is that you?  [looks out his window]
Homer: [looks up, sees the Dean looking at him] Aah!
-- Thank God for Call Display, "Homer Goes to College"

% Homer wanders the college in search of room 222, where his tutors
% live.  He knocks on the door and is let in.  When he greets the three
% nerds, who are tapping furiously at their keyboards, they answer in
% robotic voices, "Intruder Alert", and laugh.

 Homer: Look, I'm supposed to get a physics tutor.
Nerd 1: Well, you've come to the right place then.  If there's one thing
        we know, it is science.
Nerd 2: And math.
Nerd 3: And the words to every Monty Python routine.
 Nerds: [in unison] We are the Knights Who Say...Ni!  Ni!  [laughter]
 Homer: Heh heh...Ni.
-- Homer's quest for a shrubbery, "Homer Goes to College"

% At dinner that night, Homer excitedly tells the Simpson family about
% his three new friends.

Homer: We played Dungeons & Dragons for three hours!  Then I was slain
       by an elf.
 Bart: Listen to yourself, man: you're hangin' with nerds.
Homer: You take that back!
Marge: Homer, please!  These boys sound very nice, but they're clearly
       nerds.
Homer: Really?  But nerds are my mortal enemy!
 Lisa: Dad, nerds are nothing to fear.  In fact, they've done some
       pretty memorable things.  Some nerds of note include...popcorn
       magnate Orville Redenbacher, rock star David Byrne, and supreme
       court justice David Souter.
Homer: [gasp] Oh, not Souter!  Oh, no!
-- Mmm, Burgher, "Homer Goes to College"

% The three nerds try to help Homer study, but he won't put any effort
% into it.

Nerd 1: Come on, Mr. Simpson, you'll never pass this course if you don't
        know the periodic table.
 Homer: Ehh, I'll write it on my hand.
Nerd 1: Ho!  Including all known lanthanides and actinides?  Ha, ha!
        Good luck.
-- Cerium, praseodymium, neodymium..., "Homer Goes to College"

 Homer: Come on, guys.  Look at yourselves!  All you do is study.  I'm
        going to show you the true meaning of college: we're gonna go
        out and par-ty!
Nerd 2: Wait a minute, I'll put on my snow pants.
Nerd 1: Me too.
Nerd 3: Me too.
-- Don't forget the Cougar boots, "Homer Goes to College"

Ah, the college road-trip.  What better way to spread beer-fueled
mayhem?
-- Homer, "Homer Goes to College"

% Marge sees Homer loading cases of beer in the car, and she goes out to
% him.

 Marge: If you're going for a ride, I'd like you to take Bart and Lisa.
 Homer: [plaintively] But Marge, we're college guys and we're up to no
        good.
Nerd 1: Mr. Simpson, Gary spilled his ear medicine.
-- Does it stain naugahyde?, "Homer Goes to College"

% The beer-fueled mayhem turns out to be a trip to the Springfield
% petting zoo.  Lisa's happy that they let them feed the baby ducks, but
% she seems to be alone in her happiness.

Nerd 2: I need to go to the bathroom!
  Lisa: We stopped five minutes ago!
Nerd 2: Yeah, but someone knocked on the door and I couldn't go.
-- Tension and urination just don't mix, "Homer Goes to College"

% Homer still tries to figure out a way to kick-start the nerds' social
% lives.  He decides a big crazy prank might do the trick: maybe rolling
% the Dean up in a carpet and throwing him off a bridge?  Bart has a
% better idea: pignapping the Springfield A&M mascot, Sir Oinkcelot.
% Homer combines the plans, suggesting they roll the pig up in a carpet
% and throw him off a bridge, but there are no takers.
%
% Under cover of darkness, the five accomplices set out to steal Sir
% Oinkcelot.  When they lug the pig back to Homer's car, Homer starts
% playing with its tail, noticing that even if you pull it straight, it
% curls right back up again.  He does it repeatedly until the pig chomps
% on his hand in annoyance.  Homer has to be restrained from harming the
% poor innocent pig.
%
% Shortly thereafter, back at the dorm...

Nerd 1: Hey, the pig's acting kind of funny.
Nerd 2: He and Mr. Simpson split a case of malt liquor.
Nerd 3: Guys, he's really sick.
         [The pig collapses]
  Dean: [outside] Hell-oo...that sounds like a pig fainting!
-- Good ear on you, "Homer Goes to College"

% Fortunately, the pig's OK.  Homer, the Dean, and the nerds watch as
% the pig is airlifted to safety, tied into a harness under a
% helicopter.

 Dean: I'm sorry, boys, I've -- I've never expelled anyone before,
       but...that pig had some powerful friends.
Nixon: [bitterly] Oh, you'll pay.  Don't think you won't pay!
-- They are not a crook, "Homer Goes to College"

% Homer is apologetic as the gates of Sprigfield College slam closed,
% leaving the nerds out on the street with their suitcases.

 Homer: Guys, believe me, I didn't mean to get you expelled.
Nerd 3: Oh, don't worry, Mr. Simpson, we can take care of ourselves.
         [Snake appears, holding out his hand]
 Snake: Uh, wallet inspector.
Nerd 1: Oh, here ya go.  [All three give him their wallets] I believe
        that's all in order.
 Snake: Huh ho!  I can't _believe_ that worked.
 Homer: [realization dawning] Heyy...that's not the wallet inspector!
-- Coulda been, though, "Homer Goes to College"

% Homer places a worried hand to his lips, wondering what he's done.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 15:59]
%
% Homer decides the only recourse is to let them stay at the Simpson
% house.  Marge doesn't look too happy about it, but Homer pleads their
% case.

 Homer: Marge!  They don't have anywhere to stay.  And they're geniuses.
        they'll solve all our problems.  They'll elevate us to the
        status of kings on earth!
Nerd 3: Mr. Simpson?  We all have nosebleeds.
-- Genii non-savants, "Homer Goes to College"

% The nerds sit at their computer terminals once again, only this time,
% they've set them up in the Simpson's living room.  Marge idly watches
% them, then remembers a phone call she has to make.  She lifts the
% handset.

 Marge: [hearing modem noises] Ooh, what's wrong with this phone? it's
        making crazy noises.
Nerd 2: [contemptuously] Those "crazy noises" are computer signals.
Nerd 3: Yeah.  Some guys at MIT are sending us reasons why Captain
        Picard is better than Captain Kirk.
Nerd 1: Hah!  They're outta their minds.
-- The Great Debate continues, "Homer Goes to College"

% Bart and Lisa, meanwhile, are watching the Krusty the Klown Show. it's
% time for an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon: "Burning Down the Mouse".
% Lisa says she's heard about it already: "This is the one where
% Scratchy finally gets Itchy!"  Bart is suitably impressed.
%
% Itchy is tied to a stake, and he looks glum.  Scratchy rubs his hands
% in delight, then reaches for a crate next to him.  He puts sticks of
% dynamite under the mouse's eyelids and in his ears.  He fashions a
% Lincolnian hat and beard out of plastic explosive and slaps them
% rudely on Itchy, attaching grenades to his ears as crude parodies of
% earrings.  Itchy stares up in horror as a shadow looms over his face:
% Scratchy is turning a wheel, adjusting the angle of two atomic bombs
% so that their sharpened tips point directly at Itchy's eyes.  Crates
% of TNT are stacked around the atomic bombs.  Lighting the fuses on all
% the dynamite, he hails a taxi, and leaves.
%
% Slowly, the fuse burns down.  Itchy tries in vain to escape, his legs
% struggling.  Bart and Lisa watch, transfixed.  "My purpose in life is
% to witness this moment," says Bart, grasping Lisa's hand.  We see a
% close-up of Itchy's sweaty face as the inevitable draws inexorably
% closer.  The fuse burns all the way down, and --
%
% Suddenly the TV screen goes blank.  Bart and Lisa scream, horrified.
% One of the nerds rises from behind the TV, holding a plug in each
% hand.  "We need the outlet for our rock tumbler," he explains.  "Plug
% it in, Plug it in!" the two cry frantically.  "What, the rock tumbler
% or the TV?"  "The TV, the TV!"  The nerd makes it so.
%
% But it is too late.  A mushroom cloud is all that's left on the TV,
% with "THE END" written in red superimposed on it.  The children in
% Krusty's audience cheer wildly.  "Wow!" exclaims Krusty, "They'll
% never let us show that again, not in a million years!"  Bart and Lisa
% are aghast.

 Bart: [sharpening knives] Dad, start diggin' some nerd holes!
 Lisa: [plaintively] It's bad enough that they put their retainers in
       the dishwasher; can't we do something?
Homer: Look, I'm sure we can work something out where we can all live in
       harmony, right, Marge?
Marge: No, I want those geeks outta my house!
-- Who can argue with that?, "Homer Goes to College"

% The only recourse is to get the nerds back into college, thinks Homer,
% with a zany scheme of some sort.  The nerds aren't sure about the
% "zany" idea, but Homer ignores them: "I got it!  We're gonna fix it so
% you guys save the Dean's life!"
%
% In the next scene, Homer is behind the wheel, driving with a
% determined look on his face.  He checks his watch, seeing "4:59", and
% says, "Perfect."  He fishtails around the corner.

% In the Springfield General Hospital, Homer and the nerds stand beside

Nerd 2: What are you going to do, Mr. Simpson?
 Homer: Actually, I've been working on a plan.  During the exam, I'll
        hide under some coats, and hope that somehow everything will

Nerd 2: No we didn't.
 Homer: Oh.  Then I learned the real value of college is to study, and

Narrator: Ruth Powers was tried in Springfield Superior Court.  The

          him to pay all back child support.  Mr. Powers blamed the
          outcome on his lawyer, one Lionel Hutz.
          Lionel Hutz, AKA Miguel Sanchez, AKA Dr. Nguyen Van Falk, was
          paid eight dollars for his thirty-two hours of babysitting.
          He was glad to get it.
          Marge Simpson was charged with a violation of penal code
          section 618A: Wanton Destruction of Precious Antique Cans.
          She was ordered to pay fifty cents to replace the cans, and
          $2000 in punitive damages and mental anguish.
          Homer Simpson was remanded to the custody of the United States
          Army Neurochemical Research Center at Fort Meade, Maryland,
          for extensive testing.

% Bart strolls through a gallery of paintings.

% The title "The Devil and Homer Simpson" appears in front of the
% painting, which depicts Satan's head.
%
% The scene changes to a runway.  The announcer tells of the next item
% in their fall catalogue, "A vision in raspberry cream."  A model's
% shapely legs make their way down the runway.  At the end, we see Homer
% looking up delightedly at the donut atop the legs: "Pure genius!"  He
% drools.
%
% But alas, it was all a dream.  Homer awakes to find himself at the
% power plant in front of a box of donuts.  "And now to make the leap
% from dreams to reality," he says, hungrily opening the box.  But the

Lenny: Sorry, Homer.  While you were daydreaming we ate all the donuts.

% he reassures himself, "remember your training."  He reaches for the
% "Emergency Procedures" manual, and opens it up.  A square has been cut
% out of most of the pages -- a square big enough to hold a solitary
% donut.  But Homer finds no donut; all that's left is a piece of paper.

Bastard!  He's always one step ahead.
-- Homer, not realizing his own foresight, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

Flanders: Well, technically, no, but --
   Homer: [gloating] I'm smarter than the devil!

% Flanders doesn't like Homer's gloating, and he turns into a fearsome

% he giggles, putting the last little piece in his shirt pocket.
%
% That night, Homer wanders out of bed half-asleep, looking for

% against the metal of the spinning tire, and it manages to remove one
% of the nuts.  After sniffing it disdainfully, it tosses it aside.

% Bart looks out the window again to see the gremlin continuing to
% remove the nuts from the wheel.  He looks below his seat and sees a
% box of flares, but the four flares have been removed.  Jimbo is the
% culprit this time: he's lit them and put two of them in Martin's

% fire.  It gapes and loses its grip on the bus, falling off and
% bouncing down the road in a little ball of flame.  Flanders happens to

% skids to a halt and runs back to its smoking body.
%
% "Oh dear Lord," he exclaims, looking at its inert form, "it's some

% to him.  An angry claw slashes out, and Ned smiles.  "Aw, isn't that

  Patty: {Well, I liked the part about the gambling.}
-- Principal Skinner: one for two, "$pringfield"

% Just to make sure it's OK with God, Ned checks with Rev. Lovejoy.

     Ned: What do you think, reverend?

          and grow fat off kickbacks and slush funds.
Audience: Yay!
-- And everyone is happy!, "$pringfield"

     Woman: Freshen your drink, Guv'ner?

     Hippy: OK, all right, wait, now -- now dig this, man --
     Burns: Get out.
     Hippy: Ho ho, wow, oh, let me just get my head together.
     Burns: Now!

     Burns: We're building a casino!
McAllister: Arr...can you give me five minutes?
-- One bad design after another, "$pringfield"

% Mr. Burns is unimpressed.  "Idiots.  I'll design it myself!  I know

% Lisa talks to Marge at home.

 Lisa: Mom, we're having a geography pageant at school, and I don't know

 Lisa: No: Nevada makes my butt look big.

Marge: Then how about going as Florida?  You enjoy orange juice, old
       people like you --
 Lisa: Dad, what do _you_ think?
Homer: Shh!  I'm trying to teach the baby to gamble.
Marge: Why?
Homer: I got a job at Burns' casino.  As you know, it's been my lifelong

Marge: Your lifelong dream was to be a contestant on "The Gong Show",
       and you did it in 1977, remember?
        [Flashback to Homer and Barney playing a giant harmonica,

        [In Homer's memory, Marge wears a blue dress and has green hair.

%
% Bart's casino is doing well.  A lighted sign announces, "Tonight:
% Milhouse.  Next week: an evening with Jimbo."  Inside, under the odds

% Milhouse's act involves Snowball II and "The Box of Mystery."  He

 Lisa: But Dad, if I don't show up in a rubber suit shaped like the
       state of Florida, I'll be the laughing-stock of the whole school!

% Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]
%
% It's another peaceful night in Springfield.  Our favorite family are
% nestled, all snug in their beds, when a shadow falls on the front
% door.  A man approaches with a suitcase which he places on the
% doorstep and opens to reveal a large number of tools.  He seems intent
% on breaking into the front door, but he doesn't need to: Homer has
% left his keys in the lock.
%
% Santa's Little Helper growls at the intruder, but he has anticipated
% this: he hands the dog some sausages, and the dog whimpers and begins
% to eat them.  Homer wanders in, apparently still asleep, and the
% intruder holds out some sausages to him too.  He sniffs them, says
% "Mmm!", and begins to eat them, still asleep and standing up.
%
% The man enters Lisa's room first.  He pulls back her covers to reveal
% that she sleeps with her saxophone at her lips.  With each exhale, she
% plays the note E. The man deftly exchanged her saxophone for a party
% favor.  Lisa doesn't notice the difference.
%
% In Bart's room, the man pulls back his covers and finds Bart with the
% portable TV under his arm.  Again, the intruder takes in and places a
% copy of a "Coping With Loss" book in the boy's arms.  Bart mutters a
% little, but he doesn't awaken.
%
% Lastly, the man steals Marge's red pearl necklace.  She's been wearing
% it for so long that each bead makes a popping noise as he pulls it
% loose.  The intruder sneaks out of the house past Santa's Little
% Helper and Homer, who are still asleep in the front hallway.
%
% The next morning, Homer and the dog haven't moved.

 Bart: Dad...we've been robbed!
 Lisa: Wake up, Dad, wake up!  There was a burglar and he took my
       saxophone!
Homer: Woo-hoo!
 Bart: And our portable TV!
Homer: D'oh!
Marge: And my necklace!
Homer: Ehh, that's no big loss.
Marge: Homer, that necklace was a priceless Bouvier family heirloom.
Homer: Oh, you've probably got a whole drawer full of 'em.
Marge: Well, yes I do.  But they're all heirlooms too.
-- The morning after the burglar's visit, "Homer the Vigilante"

  Bart: [upset] The burglar even took my stamp collection.
  Lisa: _You_ had a stamp collection?

         [The phone rings; Bart answers it]
Nelson: Stamp collection?  Ha ha!
-- News travels fast, "Homer the Vigilante"

 Lisa: Bart's pain is funny, but mine isn't.  That saxophone was my one

       myself.
Homer: Shh, quiet, Lisa.
-- "Homer the Vigilante"

% Bart observes that the burglar has left his business card.  Marge
% reads it: "'You have just been robbed by the Springfield Cat
% Burglar'...cute."  Just then, Flanders walks in.

Flanders: Heidely-ho, neighborinos!
   Homer: Can't talk.  Robbed.  Go hell.

          Turin beach towels.
    Bart: Wow, it's a crime wave!
-- Misplaced adoration, "Homer the Vigilante"

% Principal Skinner is despondent that day as well.  "Good Lord!" he

% Homer decides to report the robbery to the Springfield police.

Wiggum: Let's get out of here!
-- Deduction at its finest, "Homer the Vigilante"

% The Springfield Shopper announces the news of the burglary in its
% headlines.  Kent Brockman reports on the bad news.

           This reporter isn't saying that the burglar is an inhuman

Professor: Yes I would, Kent.

% At a press conference, Chief Wiggum reports on the police's progress.

% Professor John Frink has even come up with a plan to foil the burglar:
% a house that runs away on giant feet when the burglar trips the alarm.
% His miniature demonstration model trips and falls, however, bursting
% into flames.  Little wooden people fall out of the house, burning.
% "The real humans won't, er, wo -- won't burn quite so fast," he
% consoles sheepishly.

% {As Bart walks down the street the next day, many bars automatically
% slam shut in front of windows.  He stops in front of one house and

% pebble to dust.  The house next door gets up on two giant legs and
% begins running away from Bart, but it trips and bursts into flame.}
%
% {The house with the lasers draws all the neighborhood kids.  They toss
% stones at it and watch them getting destroyed.  "All right!" grooves

% Homer decides to lay down some new rules for the family.

 Kent: Mr. Simpson, how do you respond to the charges that petty
       vandalism such as graffiti is down eighty percent, while heavy
       sack-beatings are up a shocking nine hundred percent?
Homer: Aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent.
       Forfty percent of all people know that.
 Kent: I see.  Well, what do you say to the accusation that your group
       has been causing more crimes than it's been preventing?
Homer: [amused] Oh, Kent, I'd be lying if I said my men weren't
       committing crimes.

Homer: Y'ello.
  Man: You _do_ realize who this is?
Homer: Uh...Marge?
  Man: No, Homer, I'm not your wife.  Although, I do enjoy her pearls.

  Man: You may be interested to know that for my next crime, I'll be

Homer: Listen, Mr. Cat Burglar, I vow to go without sleep and guard the

% The Cat Burglar wastes no time in taking advantage of the situation.

  Abe: Son, I've come to help you.  I know who the Cat Burglar is.
Homer: What?
Marge: Who?
 Bart: Huh?
 Lisa: What?
  Abe: [triumphant] Well, well, well!  Before I was just too old, and no

       wait!  Where are you going?  [meek] Come back, I'll tell you.
-- No gloating allowed, "Homer the Vigilante"

  Abe: He was right under my nose the whole time.  He lives in my
       retirement home.  His name is Malloy.
 Lisa: Wow!  How'd you track him down, Grampa?
  Abe: Good question!  On one of my frequent trips to the ground, I
       noticed Malloy wore sneakers...for sneaking.
       My next clue came yesterday at the museum.  We felt slighted by
       your age-bashing, and started home.  Malloy said, "I'll catch up
       with you."
        [Malloy shoots a rope over the building]
       I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  There was something

       largest cubic zirconia on his coffee table.
Homer: Aw, Dad, I could kiss you!
  Abe: Well, kiss me right here.  It's the only part that still has

Skinner: How ironic.
-- Moronic, that is, "Homer the Vigilante"

Malloy: Homer, old chap, well done.  If anyone was going to catch me,
        I'm glad it was you.
 Homer: Actually, it wasn't me, it was my dad, Grampa.
   Abe: Thanks, Son.  So you see, old people aren't so useless after
        all.  Malloy's old, and he outsmarted the lot of you.  And I'm

           For instance, "True Believer"?  I actually worked in a law
           firm for two months.  And then, the film "Chaplin"?  I had a

% The Simpsons watch yet another edition of "Eye on Springfield", with
% your host, Kent Brockman.

 Kent: Tonight, on "Eye on Springfield": just miles from your doorstep,
       hundreds of men are given weapons and trained to kill.  The
       government calls it the "army", but a more alarmist name would be
       -- "The Killbot Factory."
       But first: Springfield has come down with a fever.  Football
       fever, brought on by the biggest game of the year: the Pigskin
       Classic between the Shelbyville Sharks and our own Springfield
       Atoms.  If you have the fever, there's only one cure; take two
       tickets and see the game Sunday morning.
  Man: Warning: tickets should not be taken internally.
Homer: See?  Because of me, now they have a warning.
-- Something to be proud of, "Homer Loves Flanders"

% Bart decides to take advantage of the situation.

 Bart: [sly] Hey Dad, sell you these for fifty bucks...
Homer: Woo hoo!  Sold.  [gives Bart money]
        [Bart runs off]
Marge: [tired] Those aren't tickets to the game, Homer.
Homer: What do you mean?  It says right here: "Free wig with every
       purchase of large wig.  Downtown Wig Center".  Why you little --
       hmm, free wig...
        [imagines looking at himself wearing a Marge wig]
        [falsetto] I love you, Homey.  Mmm..
        [normal voice] Heh heh, I don't need her at all any more.
-- The power of fantasy, "Homer Loves Flanders"

% Homer can't resist the big game, so he camps out in front of the
% ticket booth.  And his strategy pays off -- he's second in the huge
% line.

Homer: Heh heh heh, I did it!  Second in line, and all I had to do was
       miss eight days of work.
  Man: With the money you would have made working, you could have bought
       tickets from a scalper.
Homer: In theory, yes.  [sotto voce] Jerk.
-- Marginal productivity of labor., "Homer Loves Flanders"

% The wicket opens for selling tickets.  The first man in line steps up.

  Man: Give me, er, 30,000 tickets.
Woman: That'll be $950,000 please.

       you the rest later?
Woman: Sure.
-- Gee, you think he's scamming you?, "Homer Loves Flanders"

% The man walks off with a big stack of tickets, and the woman puts a

Marty: Still waiting for that caller...
Homer: [runs in whimpering, grabs phone]
Marty: Oh, we have a winner!  What's your name, sir?
  Ned: Ned Flanders!
Homer: Oh, not Flanders, anybody but Flanders --
  Ned: Well, golly, if that doesn't put the "shaz" in "shazam."  Oh,

-- That's not the only genetic thing, either, "Homer Loves Flanders"

   Lisa: What's so special about this game anyway?  It's just another
         chapter in the pointless rivalry between Springfield and
         Shelbyville.  They built a mini-mall, so we built a bigger
         mini-mall.  They made the world's largest pizza, so we burnt
         down their city hall.
  Homer: Heh heh heh.  Yeah, they swore they'd get us back by spiking
         our water supply.  But they didn't have the guts.

       tick --
Homer: [slams the door] Why do you mock me, O Lord?
Marge: Homer, that's not God.  That's just a waffle that Bart tossed up

Homer: Ye -- no...
  Ned: [answers door] Huh?  [Homer winds up]
Homer: Oh.  [winds down] Flanders, I decided I'd like to go to the game
       with you.
  Ned: Well, get out the Crayloas and color me "Tickled Pink".  Ooh,

% {Ned and Homer take their seats.  "Well, these are amazing seats, huh,

 Stan: Ned?  Is that -- Ned Flanders?
  Ned: Heidely-ho, Stanster.

% A lynch mob takes little time to form.

  Homer: How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that.  He's a
         wonderful, kind, caring man -- maybe even more so than me.
         There have been times when I lost patience with him -- even
         lashed out at him!  -- but this man has turned every cheek on
         his body.
         If everyone here were like Ned Flanders, there'd be no need for
         heaven: we'd already be there.
          [everyone seems sympathetic]
Lovejoy: Um...well, I think we all owe Ned a heartfelt apology.  We were
         wrong to doubt him.
  Lenny: Hey, that guy's right!

Homer: Right back at you, buddy.  Now how about that game at the
       Pitch'N'Putt?
  Ned: Just try and stop me.
 Bart: I don't get it, Lis.  You said everything would be back to
       normal, but Homer and Flanders are still friends.
 Lisa: Yeah.  Maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures.

Homer: Guess what, everybody?  My great uncle Boris died and left us his

%
% It's another delicate morning in Springfield, USA.  Marge trudges out
% of bed and walks down the stairs, amidst a minefield of junk the other
% members of the family have left lying around.  "Mmm," she grumbles,
% "Sandwich," stepping on one.  Further down the stairs, she notices
% some underpants draped over the railing.
%
% The kitchen, too, is a disaster area.  Eggs are smashed on the wall;
% pizza drips gooily from the ceiling.  Checking in the fridge, Marge
% finds Homer's bowling ball -- and some more underpants.  Still, she
% prepares breakfast for the family without complaining.
%
% Homer, Lisa, and Bart walk in with a cheery, "Hi Mom!", and tuck into
% the breakfast Marge has kindly prepared.

 Bart: After breakfast, me and Milhouse are going down to the ravine.
       We got a tip from a six-year-old that there's a dead Martian down
       there.
 Lisa: And I'm going to the park to jam with "The Little White Girls
       Blues Quartet."  Wanna come with me, Daddy-O?
Homer: I'd love to, honey, but Daddy has to go to a beer-drinking
       contest today.
 Bart: Think you'll win?
Homer: Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether
       you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.
 Bart: Gotcha.
-- The wisdom of age, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% "Well, gotta go!" says Bart, getting up to leave.  Homer and Lisa do
% the same.  Marge, however, blocks the doorway.

 Bart: Uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, Mom.
Homer: [cheery] Push her down, son.
-- "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% "No one's going anywhere!"  Marge begins angrily.  "We're going to
% clean the whole house from top to bottom," she says, handing out
% buckets and mops all around.  "Oh dear God, no!" cries Homer, and in a
% panic, Bart runs to the front door and grasps it frantically, trying
% to get out.  Marge warns him that escape is impossible.

    Marge: Now each one of you take a floor and get started.
    Homer: I call the basement!
Bart+Lisa: Fine.
    Homer: [questioningly] D'oh?
            [Turns on the light in the basement, sees the huge mess]
           D'oh!
-- The cleaning spree begins, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% Bart wipes lamely away at the coffee table in the living room.

 Bart: [whining] I'm tired.  I'm hungry.  Can't we just buy a new house?
Marge: Oh, Bart, cleaning doesn't have to be a chore!  Here, work to the
       music.  [turns on the radio]
Ernie: You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
       Another day older and deeper in debt...
 Bart: Amen, Ernie.
-- Apt cleaning-music, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% In the basement, Homer wears a back-pack with an air compressor in it.
% He pulls the chain to start it, and blows all the papers on the floor
% into a swirling vortex.  Paper is strewn everywhere when he shuts it
% down and dusts his hands.

 Homer: All done.
 Marge: You're not done.  I want you to throw away these old calendars
        and TV Guides.
 Homer: Are you mad, woman?  You never know when an old calendar might
        come in handy.  Sure, it's not 1985 now, but who knows what
        tomorrow will bring?  And these TV Guides: [fondly] so many
        memories.
         [opens one] "Gomer upsets Sergeant Carter"...oh, I'll never
        forget that episode.

 Gomer: Shazam!
Carter: Pyle!
 Gomer: Shazam!
Carter: Pyle!
 Gomer: Shazam!
 Homer: Heh heh heh...Shazam.
-- Homer "cleans" the basement, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% Marge chides Homer for wasting time.

Marge: Stop remembering TV and get back to work!
Homer: What's the point of all this cleaning?  Are we so vain?!
-- Apparently, yes, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% In her room, Lisa vacuums under the bed.  She hears music from
% outside.  Looks as though the Little White Girls have decided to do a
% tour while they play.  Even better, President Clinton follows them,
% jamming on his saxophone.  Moe drives by, scolding, "Hey, Clinton!
% Get back to work!", to which Bill retorts, "Make me!"  Lisa rues the
% great time they're having while she's stuck inside; the vacuum cleaner
% she holds sucks into her saxophone, making a sound like derisive
% laughter.

% {In the basement, Homer prepares to clean the floor.}

       Homer: {[reads label on the Mr. Cleanser bottle]
              Hmm..."Use only in a well-ventilated area."  Shove it,
              buddy!
               [pours some out, starts scrubbing] Ooh...
               [the fumes get to him, and the logos on the cleansers

Mr. Cleanser: {[in a Russian accent] I must destroy you!}

% In the front room, Bart scrubs dust off Grant Wood's "American Gothic"
% with KBBL blaring its inane chatter in the background.

       
        [song finishes]
 Bart: [groans]
Marty: And that was "Take This Job and Shove It."  Now let's make
       another one of our lucky phone calls --
 Bill: OK, just answer the phone with the special phrase that pays and
       you'll have your choice of $10,000 in cash --
        [cash register bell sounds]
       -- or a really stuuupid prize.
        [cuckoo clock chimes]
        [goofy laughter]
Marty: Well, let's make that call.
        [phone next to Bart rings]
 Bart: KBBL's going to give me something stupid!
  Abe: Bart, I'm having palpitations!
 Bart: Can't tie up the line, Grampa.  [hangs up]
-- And you didn't call 911 because...?, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% Finally, the arduous task is complete.  Bart, Lisa, and Homer all look
% tattered and tired.  "There," consoles Marge, "isn't that a lot
% better?  Now you can do whatever you want, but don't mess up the
% house."  The three respond, "We won't," and they wander into the
% kitchen.  As the door swings closed and then open again, the kitchen
% changes from spotless to a total mess.

 Marty: Now let's try another lucky phone call.
         [phone rings]
Wiggum: Help!  Help us!  They stole our uniforms, guns, and tasers!
 Snake: [wearing a police uniform] Fry, piggy.  [charges taser]
Wiggum: No, no -- no don't -- aargh!
        Aargh!
        A little to the left...
        Ah, that's the stuff.
  Bill: Oh, I'm sorry.  The phrase is, "KBBL is going to give me
        something stupid."  Pretty weird, hyuck, hyuck.  ["sproing"
        noise]
-- It's probably just a joke, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

Marty: Let's try one more number.
Homer: Y'ello?
 Bart: [grabs phone] KBBL is going to give me something stupid!
Marty: Well, hot dog!  We have a weiner!  [car alarm noise]
Homer: [grasping air] Y'ello?
 Bart: I won, I won!
Marty: You win your choice of $10,000 or -- what's our gag prize this
       week, Bill?
 Bill: [raucous] A full-grown African Elephant!
 Bart: Well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, Marty, but I think
       I'm going to have to go with the elephant.
Homer: [to Marge, happily] He's taking the elephant instead of the
       money.
Marty: [whispering] The kid wants the elephant!
 Bill: We don't have an damn elephant.
Marty: Don't whisper into the mike!
 Bill: Ahem, kid, the elephant's a gag prize.  Nobody takes the gag
       prize.  [nervous laughter] You want the cash.
 Bart: [indignant] I want the elephant!
Homer: Heh, heh, stick it to the man!
-- Homer, forever anti-authority, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% Reason rears its ugly head, however, and Homer tries to convince Bart
% to take the money instead.

Homer: Bart!  With $10,000, we'd be millionaires!  We could buy all
       kinds of useful things like...love!
Marge: Or double-ply windows.  They look just like regular windows but
       they'll save us 4% on our heating bill.
        [long pause]
       Well they will.
 Lisa: You all seem to be forgetting the most important thing...which is
       that it's wrong to imprison an animal!
        [long pause]
Homer: Lisa, go to you room.
-- Homer deals with opposition, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% Bart & Homer arrive at KBBL, where Bart demands his elephant.

Marty: [sheepish laughter] We appreciate you coming down, but, heh, look
       kid, the thing us, uh heh heh...we don't _have_ an elephant, heh
       heh.
 Bill: Come on, kid: just take the money, huh?  Otherwise we might get
       fired.  You don't want us to get fired, do you?
 Bart: Ehh, either way.
        [the DJs gasp]
-- The cruelty of ten-year-olds, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

  Marty: We think we know how your mind works, Bart.  So how about this:
         we pay your principal $10,000 to pull down his pants and keep
         them down for the rest of the school year, ha ha!
Skinner: I'll do it, Bart.
   Bart: Ermmm...no.
   Bill: OK, OK...what if we use the $10,000 to, er, surgically
         transform Skinner here into, er...some kind of a lobster-like
         creature?
Skinner: Now wait just a minute: that wasn't discussed with me.
-- Going over his head, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% Bart is inexorable: "Uh, Gentlemen, I am not leaving without my
% elephant."  But he and Homer are both tossed out anyway.  "Where's my
% elephant?"  Bart demands at the window repeatedly.  The DJs close the
% window, but over the song they play next, Bart's queries can still be
% heard faintly.  At the Springfield Retirement Castle, Abe notes, "Hey,
% they're playing the elephant song!"  Jasper loves that; it reminds him
% of elephants.  Kent Brockman even editorializes, "So isn't that what
% we're all asking in our own lives -- 'where's my elephant?'  I know
% that's what I've been asking."
%
% At the KBBL studios, Bill and Marty's boss gives them a dressing-down.

   Boss: Look, our ratings are down, and the station is being swamped
         with angry calls and letter-bombs.
          [A few letter-bombs explode in a pile]
         And it's all your fault!
   Bill: Yes it is, ma'am.
   Boss: This is the DJ 3000.  It plays CDs automatically, and it has
         three distinct varieties of inane chatter.
          [presses a button]
DJ 3000: [stilted] Hey, hey.  How about that weather out there?
         Woah!  _That_ was the caller from hell.
         Well, hot dog!  We have a weiner.
   Bill: Man, that thing's great!
  Marty: _Don't_ praise the machine!
   Boss: If you don't get that kid an elephant by tomorrow, the DJ 3000
         gets your job.
          [Marty punches it]
DJ 3000: Those clowns in congress did it again.  What a bunch of clowns.
   Bill: [laughs] How does it keep up with the news like that?
-- Misplaced admiration, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% Next morning, Marge hears the doorbell.  She rushes downstairs and
% pulls the dinning room curtains open.  She's greeted by a large,
% staring eye.  Bill and Marty drive off as the family check out the
% elephant left them.  "Woah!"  Bart cries happily, and the elephant
% trumpets savagely.  Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II scamper off
% in fright.  They pause on the horizon, peeking over, and whisk out of
% sight when the elephant trumpets again.
%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 8:13]
%
% The elephant makes grunting noises and a ferocious face.

Marge: Homer...it looks like it could gore.
Homer: Heh heh...it _does_ look like Al Gore.
 Bart: [admiring] Ew, he smells worse than anything.  Hey you, elephant!
       Lift me up on your back, man.
        [elephant stuffs him in its mouth]
Marge: Bart!
        [Bart gets out with a plop]
 Bart: [nervous laughter] He tried to kill me.

-- Pros and cons of keeping the elephant, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% Just then, the elephant walks towards the side of the house and rubs
% up against it to scratch himself, tearing the outside layer of the
% house off.  "Look," laughs Bart, "he thinks he's people."
%
% Homer decides to chain the elephant to a tree in the backyard.  Not
% liking the idea, the elephant angrily breaks his chain and stomps on a
% few Simpson items.  Bart decides to call the elephant "Stampy".

       [Stampy trumpets]
Homer: What's he yelling about?
 Lisa: He's hungry.  Here you go Stampy: [holds a platter] eat it slow.
       It has to last for --
        [Stampy grabs it all at once]
       You ate it too fast.
Homer: Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so
       hungry.
 Lisa: You can't do that, Dad, it's cruel!
Homer: Oh, everything's cruel according to you.  Keeping him chained up
       in the back yard is cruel.  Pulling on his tail is cruel.
       Yelling in his ears is cruel.  Everything is cruel.  Well, excuse
       me if I'm cruel!
        [Stampy stuffs Homer in his mouth; Homer struggles out]
       Now I've had my head in an elephant, a hippo, and a giant sloth.
-- Three for impressive three, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% To solve the food problem, Homer takes Stampy to Moe's for the "Free
% Peanuts."  But Moe warns, "I think you're taking unfair advantage of
% my generous offer."  Homer tells him to shut up.

       [Stampy lies weakly on the ground]
 Lisa: He can't just eat peanuts, Dad, he needs plants to live.
Homer: [crafty] Plants, eh?
        [At the Springfield Arboretum "(Tree place)"]
 Bart: Strip the bark now, Stampy.
Homer: Hey: any more arboretums around here?
  Man: No!
-- Too much of a good thing, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% {Just then, a bird lands on Stampy's back and starts to peck.}

Homer: {That bird!  He's killing the elephant.  Stop him!}
 Lisa: {No, Dad, he's grooming him.}
Homer: {[crafty] Grooming him, eh?
        [later, at home]}
Marge: {Ooh, Homer, there's a bird on your head!}
Homer: {I know.  He's grooming me.  Mmm...elephant fresh.}
-- Fresh as you can get, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% Stampy has no problem quieting the neighborhood dogs at night: one
% might trumpet, and the dogs shut up.  Just as well, because it makes
% it easier for Bart to sleep out in the tree fort.  "Good night,
% Stampy," he calls, and the elephant pulls Bart's covers over him.  He
% then caresses Bart's head with his trunk and wraps it around Bart as
% if to hug him.  Just as Bart gets comfortable, Stampy yanks him out
% and stuffs him in his mouth.  Bart taps on his cheek, and Stampy puts
% him back in his sleeping bag, covered with drool.  "Thanks, bud.
% 'Preciate it."

 Lisa: Taught Stampy any tricks yet, Bart?
 Bart: Nah.  He doesn't want to learn, and I don't want to teach him.
       We get along fine.

Homer: Oh.  Good luck!

Homer: Look at these bills: chains for elephant.  Shots for elephant.
       -- "Oversized decorative poncho"?!
 Bart: Technically it's for a giraffe, but I think I can let it out a
       little.
Homer: Well these bills will have to paid out of your allowance.
 Bart: You'll have to raise my allowance to about $1000 a week.
Homer: Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.
        [doorbell rings]
 Girl: Can we see the elephant?
  Boy: We'll pay you money...
Homer: For the ninth time, no!
        [slams door; doorbell rings again]
       Wait a minute...this gives me an idea.
        [hammers a "Go away" sign into the ground outside]
 Bart: Uh, here's a better sign, Dad.
        ["See the elephant, $1.  Ride the elephant, $2"]
Homer: I don't have time to read it.  Just give me the gist of it, son.
-- Well, OK, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% What a success Bart's idea becomes.  The yard is full of people who
% want to see and ride the elephant.  One child is tossed angrily away
% by Stampy, and Homer wants to charge his mother for the five-foot
% ride.

Mrs. Lovejoy: That animal of yours is certainly bad-tempered.
        Lisa: Yeah, well you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of
              your natural habitat and gawked at by a bunch of slack-
              jawed yokels.
         Man: Hey, Moe: look at that pointy-hairded little girl.  Hyuck.
-- Slack-jawed, indeed, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% Bart feels that he and Stampy are misunderstood.  Mr. Burns reminisces
% to Smithers how riding Stampy reminds him of the fat man he used to
% ride to work.

Homer: Look at this, Marge: $58 and all of it profit!  I'm the smartest
       businessman in the world.
Marge: Stampy's food bill today was $300.
Homer: Marge, please, don't humiliate me in front of the money.
-- A fate worse than death, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% Homer decides to up the prices -- to $100 for a view and $500 for a
% ride.  Everyone can't leave quickly enough.

          Homer: Uh, Milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once,
                 right?
Mrs. Van Houten: Yes, but we paid you $4.
          Homer: Well, that was under our old price structure.  Under
                 our new price structure, your bill comes to a total of
                 $700.  Now, you've already paid me $4, so that's just
                 $696 more that you owe me.
 Mr. Van Houten: Get off our property.
-- So much for that idea, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% Homer finally realizes that they can't afford to keep the elephant.
% When he suggests selling him, Bart is against it.  SLH and S II play
% "Mary Had a Little Lamb" on the toy piano in the background.

  Man: Well, sir, I'll be honest with you: I need a large African
       elephant and I need it today.  But I'm afraid this just isn't
       what I'm looking for.
Homer: What do you mea?  It's an elephant, isn't it?
  Man: Well, it is, and it isn't.  If you understand what I mean.
Homer: [pause]
        [happily] He likes peanuts.
-- A good selling-point, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

Warden: Our wildlife refuge is the ideal environment for your elephant:
        thousands of acres of simulated African savannah.
  Lisa: It's perfect, Dad.
 Homer: I only have two questions: "How much", and "Give it to me".
Warden: Well, we really can't offer you any money, we're a non-profit
        organization.
 Homer: So your bid is zero.
Warden: Well, we like to think of it as --
 Homer: Thank you.
Warden: You know I really think --
 Homer: Thank you.

Blackheart: Mr. Simpson, I think you'll find this amount more than fair.
      Lisa: Dad, I think he's an ivory dealer!  His boots are ivory, his
            hat is ivory, and I'm pretty sure that check is ivory.
     Homer: Lisa, a guy who's got lots of ivory is _less_ likely to hurt
            Stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low.
       SLH: [growling] We...love...you.
      Lisa: Mr. Blackheart?
Blackheart: Yes, my pretty?
      Lisa: Are you an ivory dealer?
Blackheart: [laughs] Well, little girl, I've had lots of jobs in my day:
            whale-hunter, seal-clubber, president of the Fox network,
            and, like most people, yeah, I've dealt a little ivory.
      Bart: Dad, you can't do this.  Stampy is my friend.
     Homer: Don't worry, son.  I'll get you a new elephant.
Blackheart: I'll take that one too.
     Homer: Done.
-- Let's make a deal, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

Blackheart: All right, I'll be back in the morning to pick up Stampy.

Blackheart: Elephants don't have keys.
     Homer: Well, I'll just keep these then.
-- Little-known facts, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

 Bart: Don't worry, Stampy.  I won't let Homer sell you to that ivory

% down the door.
%
% Bart can't find Stampy anywhere.  He calls out for him, and is
% delighted to hear a trumpet in return.  He looks over and sees the
% shadow of an elephant behind some bushes, but when he runs through
% them, he finds it's just the preserved skeleton of a wooly mammoth
% that wandered into the Springfield tar pits.  The trumpeting was a
% recording.
%
% Bart is sure Stampy's gone forever, but just then he hears Stampy's
% distinctive call, and he looks over.  It's Stampy, all right.  But his
% trunk reaches fondly towards the mammoth skeleton, and the plucky ten-

       connected to.
 Bart: Dad, I can't let you sell him.  Stampy and I are friends.
        [Stampy beats him with his trunk] Ow!  Anyway, I want him to go
       to that animal refuge.
Homer: Forget it!  That elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
 Lisa: Dad, how would _you_ like to be sold to an ivory dealer?
Homer: I'd like it fine.
 Bart: Even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys?
Homer: Yes, of course I would!  Who wouldn't like that -- to be part of

Homer: Elephant, honey.  It's an elephant!
-- Well, duh, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% "And I'm sure he'll make a grand piano," Homer continues, but Bart and

Homer: I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy after he saved my

%
% It's another day at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.  Homer sits
% idly at his work station, rolling a donut morosely back and forth.

Homer: [sighs] Lousy job.  Nothing exciting ever happens.
        [A fanfare plays; an emcee and a scantily clad woman appear]
Emcee: Congratulations, Homer Simpson!  You've just won the employee
       raffle.
Homer: Woo hoo!  What do I get?
Emcee: The job of industrial chimney sweep.
        [Silence; a "BIG WINNER!" sign flashes in the background]
Homer: Woo hoo!
-- Delayed reaction, "Burns' Heir"

% The job consists of being strung from a crane with batting wrapped
% around oneself and dipped into tall smokestacks.  Homer is pulled from
% the chimney coughing from the soot -- "Hey!  This isn't such a great
% prize" -- but he consoles himself with the fact that the big guys at
% the top work even harder.
%
% Cut to Mr. Burns sitting in his bathtub watching Homer on TV.  Burns
% sports a top hat and cigar; an open bag of extra fancy potato chips
% rests on a stool next to him.  Munching on a chip, he sighs, "Will
% five o'clock _never_ come?"

   Burns: Careful, Smithers!  That sponge has corners, you know.
Smithers: I'll go find a spherical one, sir.
-- Mr. Burns takes a bath, "Burns' Heir"

% Smithers leaves, putting the sponge on Mr. Burns' hat.  The weight of
% it is too much for the feeble Burns, and he sinks slowly into the bath
% water.  Fearing his death, his life flashes before his eyes.  A baby
% Monty drinks from a bottle in a nanny's arms, but the milk is not to
% his liking, and in a fit of pique, he fires her.  As a young man,
% Burns shoots a gun at another man's feet, telling him, "Dance!"  The
% man does so briefly, then stops while Burns reloads.

Man 1: All right!  We're finally going to stop those corporate pigs from
       dumping that nuclear waste!
Man 2: Oh, no!  Our boat is sinking!
Burns: It was I, you fools!  The man you trusted wasn't Wavy Gravy at
       all!  [tosses a guitar away] And all this time, I've been smoking
       harmless tobacco.
-- Burns foils Greenpeace, "Burns' Heir"

% Wavy Burns jumps off the boat, pulls the cord to inflate his life
% jacket, and swims off cackling.
%
% Smithers returns to the bathroom.

Smithers: I got a mink chamois, sir, I hope it -- Oh my God!  Mr. Burns
          is dead!  [sobs] Why do the good always die so young?
   Burns: [rising from the water] You almost killed me!  [strangles him]
Smithers: Please...sir...[wraps a towel around him] You'll catch...
          cold...
-- Devotion to duty, "Burns' Heir"

% Later, Mr. Burns sits in front of the fire tended by Smithers.

   Burns: Smithers, do you realize if I had died, there would be no one
          to carry on my legacy.  Due to my hectic schedule and
          lethargic sperm, I never fathered an heir.  Now I have no one
          to leave my enormous fortune to.  No one.
Smithers: Ahem --
   Burns: You, Smithers?  Oh no, my dear friend.  I've planned a far
          greater reward for you.  When I pass on, you shall be buried
          alive with me.  [Opens a miniature coffin containing dead
          Burns and aghast Smithers]
Smithers: Oh...goody.
-- Contagious enthusiasm, "Burns' Heir"

% The next scene is at a movie theater where "Siskel and Ebert: The
% Movie" is playing.  The movie begins with a promo for THX sound which
% is powerful enough to shatter Hans Moleman's glasses, break a man's
% teeth, make an exit sign explode, pull plaster from the ceiling, and
% cause a man's head to explode.  Everyone cheers anyway, except for
% Abe, who calls, "Turn it up!  Turn it up!"
%
% Instead of previews, Mr. Burns is shown in a large green field.

Burns: Hello, I'm Montgomery Burns.
Homer: Aah!
Burns: Now then, I'm looking for a suitable young male heir to leave my
       fortune to when I pass away -- my vast, vast, _vast_ fortune.
       Vast.
        [audience chatters]
Burns: Auditions will be tomorrow at my estate.  And now, our feature
       presentation!  [whispering from off camera]
       Oh, for -- oh, very well.  ["For He's a Jolly Good Fellow"
       starts]
        [sings] Let's all go to the lobby,

       Get ourselves some snacks.
-- Shameless plugs for popcorn, "Burns' Heir"

% The next night, at Burns' estate, every young boy in Springfield is
% there with his parents, including Martin, Milhouse, Ralph, and Bart.
% In his private auditorium, Mr. Burns sits in a row by himself, the
% illustrious Smithers holding a clipboard behind him.  First up on the
% tryout list is Milhouse.

Milhouse: I have nothing to offer you but my love.
   Burns: I specifically said, no geeks!
Milhouse: But my mom says I'm cool...
   Burns: Next!
  Nelson: Gimme your fortune or I'll pound your withered old face in!
   Burns: Oh, I like his energy.  Put him on the callback list.
  Martin: [walks out as music begins]
          Clang, clang, clang went the trolley!
          Ring, ring, ring went the bell!
          Zing, zing, zing went my heartstrings -- oof!  [Nelson belts
          him]
   Burns: Thank you!  Give the bully an extra point.
-- The tryouts begin, "Burns' Heir"

    Lisa: [clears throat] I propose to you that your heir not need be a
          boy.  In this phallocentric society of ours --
   Burns: Er, I don't know what phallocentric means, but no girls!
Milhouse: [offstage, in drag] So much for Plan B.
-- Lousy four-syllable words, "Burns' Heir"

% Next up is Bart.

Homer: That's it, boy: you're our last hope.
 Bart: Aw, I just don't want to be here, Dad.  Besides, I started a fire
       this morning that I really should keep an eye on.
-- Bart gets cold feet, "Burns' Heir"

% Marge tries to steel his courage by reminding him that he'll have his
% whole future provided for.  In her imagination, Bart walks across the
% stage at Harvard to receive his diploma.  Marge watches proudly from
% the audience until Lee Majors approaches her and asks her to come away
% with him.  She readily agrees, and he carries her in his arms and
% leaps bionically into the air.  Back in reality, Marge thinks she
% should stop fantasizing about the bionic man, but says, "Ehh, one
% more."

Homer: OK, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say.  Just read it and
       you're a shoo-in!
 Bart: [walks onstage, squints at cue cards] Hello, Mr. ...Kurns.  I bad
       want...money now.  Me sick.
Homer: Ooh, he card-reads good.
 Bart: So pick please me, Mr. Burns.
Homer: {[calling from offstage] It's "Kurns", stupid!}
Marge: {No it's not!}
Homer: {Disregard.}
-- "Burns' Heir"

% Burns is so frustrated at Bart's incompetence that he orders everyone
% out except for Bart, who he orders one step to the left.  Bart
% complies, only to have Burns turn some giant wheels to manipulate a
% boot to kick him.  Homer can't contain his mirth -- "The boot kicked
% Bart!  It kicked him right in the butt!" he laughs.
%
% As the family walk down the driveway afterwards, Marge observes her
% children's melancholy.

Marge: I think Bart and Lisa are feeling a little upset right now.
       Isn't there something you'd like to say?
Homer: There sure is.  Kids, you tried your best, and you failed
       miserably.  The lesson is, never try.  Heh heh heh -- right in
       the butt.  That was great.
-- A one-track mind, "Burns' Heir"

% Burns, too, is dejected.  He sits in his office to mull things over.

   Burns: It's no use.  I guess I'll have to leave all my money to the
          Egg Advisory Council.  Eggs have gotten quite a bad rap
          lately, you know, Smithers.
           [A rock crashes through the window]
          Ooh, look!  A bird has become petrified and lost its sense of
          direction.
Smithers: I think it's a rock, sir.
   Burns: We'll see what the lab has to say about _that_.
-- Rock, petrified bird...what's the difference?, "Burns' Heir"

% Another petrified bird joins the first.  The two men go over to the
% window to look for the flock, but instead they see Bart smashing
% windows with reckless abandon.  "Why, that rapscallion is breaking all
% my windows!" observes Burns.  And that's not all -- Bart wraps a loop
% of hose around some statues' heads, puts the nozzle in a car, and
% turns the water on, thereby popping the heads right off _and_ flooding
% the car.  To add insult to injury, Bart removes the "No Solicitors"
% sign from Burns' gate; the results are immediate.

Burns: Heh heh, look, Smithers -- a creature of pure malevolence.  He's
       the perfect one to suckle at my proverbial teat.  [opens window]
       You there, boy!  What day is this?
  Boy: [cockney accent] Today?  Sir, why, it's Christmas Day!
Burns: I was talking to _him_.  You!  What day is this?
 Bart: Huh?
Burns: I'll tell you what day this is: today is the day you become my
       heir!
        [Bart throws a rock which hits Smithers in the head]
       Ooh, I like him a _lot_.
-- "Burns' Heir"

% [End of Act One.  Time: 7:56]
%
% Homer signs the legal documents to make Bart Mr. Burns' heir in the
% Simpson dining room as reporters look on.

Burns: Just sign here, and your son will stand to inherit my entire
       estate.
Homer: Woo hoo!  We're rich!  Bart, get over to the mansion and open up
       all the windows.  We want to get the old people smell out before
       we move in.
 Lisa: Dad, Mr. Burns hasn't passed away yet.
Homer: Huh?  Oh, right.  So, I guess you're in OK shape, huh?  No heart
       problems or anything?
Burns: Well I --
Homer: Boo!
        [Abe collapses, struggling and groaning]
  Abe: [from the floor] I'm OK!
-- One way to find out, "Burns' Heir"

% Burns leaves; the family see him off.

 Bart: Now that you've agreed to reap the windfall of my death, I must
       return to my large, empty mansion to rattle around and await the
       inevitable -- alone.
Marge: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Homer: Yeah.  Let's push him down the steps.
-- That's not it, "Burns' Heir"

Marge: Bart, since he is giving you all of his money, maybe it would be
       nice if you'd spend some time with him.
 Bart: Well...
Marge: Come on, honey.
 Bart: All right.
Homer: Aw, how come Bart gets to do that and I can't spend one night
       lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boy-Ar-Dee's house?
-- Just because, OK?, "Burns' Heir"

% Bart goes over for dinner.  He sits at one end of a long table while
% Monty sits at the other.

Burns: Bart, I know you children see me as some sort of "booger man",
       but I'm really not such a bad dude.  Oh, your milk's gone cold --
       I'll ring for the maid.
        [pushes a button; metal bars spring out around Bart's jaw and
       wrists]
       Oh, sorry -- wrong button.
 Bart: Uh...I think I'd like to go home.
Burns: Oh, this day, you can have anything you want to eat.  Even...some
       sort of gelatin dish.  It's made from hooves, you know.

% -- Krusty walks in with a pizza, then demands his $400.  Bart wonders
% how Krusty can be on TV live and be delivering a pizza at the same
% time, and Krusty tells him they just play a rerun, assuring him no one
% will no the difference.  Too bad the rerun was the one from when the
% Falkland Islands were invaded.
%
% {Bart decides to stick around after dinner, and Burns takes him into a
% room with lots of TVs.  Burns explains he has hidden cameras in every
% home in Springfield.  "I got the idea from that movie 'Sliver' -- what

%
% {One shows Moe talking to himself in a mirror, wearing fatigues.  "Are

% {Another screen shows Homer sneaking into the bathroom, locking the
% door, and eating the heads off flowers.  "So _that_ explains his

%
% At home that night, Bart describes his evening to his family.

Bart: And I had the greatest time!  Mr. Burns' house has everything -- a

Lisa: It couldn't possibly be bottomless.
Bart: Well, for all intents and purposes.

 Bart: Oh, yuck: meatloaf.  My most hated of all loafs.  [feeds his

Homer: [gasps] That was the end piece!  That's it -- being abusive to
       your family is one thing, but I will not stand idly by and watch

% {Bart walks out of the living room and} rides his bike off to Burns'

Skinner: Uh, excuse me, is there an Orange Julius stand on this floor?
   Hutz: I'll sell you this one, it's almost full.
Skinner: Well, why don't I drink out of a toilet bowl.
   Hutz: He'll be back.  And as for your case, don't you worry.  I've

Milhouse: Cool train!  Where does it go?
    Bart: Beats me.  But it won't be back for three hours and forty

% Screeching to a halt, he sighs, "That was some ride," and the elf pops
% up from the back seat: "You're telling me."
%
% Marge and Homer resort to "Conformco Brain Deprogrammers."

Deprogrammer: Absolutely.  I'm the one who successfully deprogrammed

% piled on shelves, and Itchy wastes no time in grabbing one and
% pounding Scratchy flat with it.  The nasty mouse throws the stunned
% cat on a conveyor belt where he is rolled flatter, stamped with the
% pattern for a bill, sliced up into individual notes, and stacked in a
% tray.  Itchy grabs the piles of legal-tender Scratchy, throws them in
% an armored car, and drives into a tycoon convention, wherein dogs in
% suits stand around smoking cigars.  Itchy hands one of them a bill
% with which to light his cigar, and the dog lights it.  As the flame

Homer: You see, Marge?  Do you see?
Marge: Homer, when are you going to give up this crazy sugar scheme?
Homer: Never, Marge!  Never.  I can't live the button-down life like
       you.  I want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the
       creamy middles.  Sure, I might offend a few of the bluenoses with
       my cocky stride and musky odors -- oh, I'll never be the darling
       of the so-called "City Fathers" who cluck their tongues, stroke
       their beards, and talk about "What's to be done with this Homer
       Simpson?"
Marge: Look, just get rid of the sugar, OK?
Homer: No!  [Marge leaves]
        [a swarm of bees lands on Homer and the sugar pile]
       Aah!  Hey, get off my sugar.  Bad bees!  Bad!  [gets stung]
       Ow.  Oww!  Oh, they're defending themselves somehow.
-- Yeah, they'll do that, "Lisa's Rival"

% Bart walks into Lisa's room to see what she's doing.

     Lisa: Look, Bart.  It almost killed me, but I handcrafted all 75
           characters from Oliver Twist.  And now, the coup de grace: a
           bitter snowstorm.
            [turn on fan, sprinkles confetti]
Bart+Lisa: Ooh!
            [the diorama lifts up, then blows out the window]
     Bart: Uh oh.  [crash]
     Lisa: [with trepidation] Is it OK?
     Bart: Well...the important thing is, _we_ survived.
-- Small mercies, "Lisa's Rival"

Lisa: Oh, who am I kidding?  There's no _way_ I'm ever going to beat
      Alison.
Bart: Sure there is!  ...but it involves being a bit underhanded, a bit
      devious, a bit -- as the French say -- Bartesque.
Lisa: I'll do whatever it takes.
Bart: Then welcome to the nether regions of the soul.
-- No hyperbole in this household, "Lisa's Rival"

% Bart closes Lisa's venetian blind and grabs a piece of paper and a
% pencil.

Bart: Now, here's what we do.  Tomorrow morning when Alison comes out of
      her house, we spray her with the hose -- soaking her from head to
      toe, leaving us relatively dry.
Lisa: "Relatively"?
Bart: Well, there's bound to be some splash-back.
Lisa: Bart, her being wet won't help me win the competition.
Bart: Well...we could just sabotage her diorama, humiliating her in
      front of the students and faculty.
Lisa: Perfect!
Bart: Leaving her primed for the most dramatic hose-soaking of her life!
Lisa: Enough with the hose!
-- A one-track mind, "Lisa's Rival"

% At Goldsboro's Honey, two beekeepers discuss the day.

Beekeeper 1: Well, sure is quiet in here today.
Beekeeper 2: Yes, a little too quiet, if you know what I mean.
Beekeeper 1: Hmm...I'm afraid I don't.
Beekeeper 2: You see, bees usually make a lot of noise.  No noise --
             suggests no bees!
Beekeeper 1: Oh, I understand now.  Oh look, there goes one now.
Beekeeper 2: To the Beemobile!
Beekeeper 1: You mean your Chevy?
Beekeeper 2: Yes.
-- Again with the West/Ward jokes!, "Lisa's Rival"

% The beekeepers track their bees down to Homer's sugar pile.

Beekeeper 1: Well, very clever, Simpson, luring our bees to your sugar
             pile and selling them back to us at an inflated price.
      Homer: Bees are on the what now?
Beekeeper 2: Simpson, you diabolical...we're willing to pay you $2000
             for the swarm.  [starts counting money]
      Homer: Deal!
              [thunder crashes, rain starts]
Beekeeper 1: Oh, wait a minute.  The bees are leaving.
      Homer: No!  My sugar is melting.  Melting!  Oh, what a world.
              [thief spits out his tea]
      Homer: [weeps] My sugar's gone...
      Marge: [walk out with umbrella] I'm sorry, Homey.
      Homer: It's OK, Marge.  I've learned my lesson.  A mountain of
             sugar is too much for one man.  It's clear now why God
             portions it out in those tiny packets, and why he lives on
             a plantation in Hawaii.
-- And Homer should know, too, "Lisa's Rival"

% It's the big diorama contest day at Springfield Elementary.

Skinner: Ah, "Diorama-Rama", my favorite school event next to "Hearing-
         Test Thursday".
          [he and Miss Hoover walk up to Nelson's diorama]
 Hoover: "The Grapes of Wrath"?  I don't get it.
 Nelson: Here's the grapes...and here's the wrath!
          [pounds grapes with a mallet, soaking Skinner and Miss Hoover]
          [all the kids groan]
Skinner: [dismissive] Yes, yes, very good wrath.
-- Remarkable control of his temper, "Lisa's Rival"

Skinner: Ah, let's see: our foreign exchange student Uter has chosen
         "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory".  I -- but this is just an
         empty box!
   Uter: [chocolate on his face and hands] I begged you to look at mine
         first...I begged you!
-- An eight-fold double-corrugated fourteen-gauge box, no less, "Lisa's
    Rival"

% Bart walks in with a box covered by a sheet.

    Bart: Lisa, here is -- as the French say -- le fake diorama.  I'll
          create a diversion and you make the switch.
           [walks to center of gym]
          Hey everybody, whoa!  Look at me, I'm over here.  Turn this
          way right now!
  Sherri: Hey, it's Bart!
Milhouse: And he's doin' stuff!
           [everyone turns to look, fascinated]
           [Lisa grabs Alison's diorama, leaves the other one there, and
          hides Alison's in a trap door in the gym floor]
 Skinner: Bart, stop creating a diversion and get out of here!
           [Bart caws like a crow and leaves]
-- Quoth the raven, indeed, "Lisa's Rival"

% Lisa and Bart give each other the thumbs-up.

  Hoover: OK, our next entry is "The Tell-Tale Heart" by Alison Taylor.
 Skinner: Mmm, I can't wait to see this.  [low voice] Be ready with the
          ribbon.
           [pulls cover off to reveal bloody animal heart]
Children: Ew!
  Hoover: What _is_ it?
    Bart: [disguising his voice] It's a cow's heart.  [changing voices]
          They're trying to make a monkey out of you.  [Lisa smiles]
 Skinner: Alison, is this supposed to be some kind of joke?
  Alison: I didn't do that...I made a different one.
 Skinner: Oh, is that so, young lady?  Where is this "phantom diorama"?
  Alison: Uh, I don't know...
           [Lisa hears a heart beating, and looks worried]
 Skinner: Aw, at least have the guts to take the blame, girl.  You're
          only compounding your folly by lying about it.
    Bart: Right on!
 Skinner: Young lady, cow hearts belong in a butcher's window, not the
          classroom.
           [Lisa hears the heart getting louder, frets]
          Well, maybe in an older students' biology classroom, but
          that's none of my business.  Elementary school is where I
          wound up, and it's too late to do anything about that!
-- Losing track of the point, "Lisa's Rival"

% Skinner confesses he's starting to regret having skipped Alison ahead,
% and she sobs.  Meanwhile, the heartbeat is getting louder in Lisa's
% ears.  She looks down to see the trap door beating too.  Alison sobs a
% bit more, then Lisa loses it and screams.

   Lisa: Aah!  It's the beating of that hideous heart!
          [everyone looks at her]
         I mean, I think I hear something.
          [opens trap door, retrieves diorama]
         Why, here's Alison's real diorama.  It got misplaced...[laughs
         a bit] or so it would seem.
Skinner: Oh, well, that changes everything.  Let's have a look.
         [quietly to Miss Hoover] Get the ribbon ready.
          [pulls sheet off]
         Oh...a little...sterile...no _real_ insight.  What do you
         think, Miss Hoover?
 Hoover: Ehh.
          [Lisa gasps, looks at Alison]
Skinner: This has been a very disappointing day.  All right, on to Lisa
         Simpson.
   Bart: You're a shoo-in now, Lis.
   Lisa: After the way I've behaved, I don't deserve to win.
Skinner: Well, this doesn't deserve to win.
   Lisa: What?
-- Just desserts, "Lisa's Rival"

Skinner: Ooh, now we're into the dregs.  Here's Ralph Wiggum's entry.
          [pulls sheet off]
         Pre-packaged "Star Wars" characters, still in their display
         box?  Are those the limited-edition action figures?
  Ralph: What's a diorama?
Skinner: Why it's Luke, and Obi-Wan, and my favorite, Chewie!  They're
         all here!  [to Miss Hoover] What do you think?
 Hoover: [bored] I think it's lunch time.
Skinner: We have a winner!
-- Nonbiased judging, "Lisa's Rival"

% The children cheer as Lisa and Alison look at each other in disbelief.
%
% After school, Lisa apologizes to Alison for her egregious behavior.

  Lisa: I'm really sorry about what I did, Alison.  It's no shame being
        second to you.
Alison: Thank you, Lisa.  You know, I'm actually kind of glad I lost.
        Now I know that losing isn't the end of the world.  Hey, you
        still think we can be friends?
  Lisa: Only if we're the best.
 Ralph: [skipping with his diorama] I beat the smart kids!  I beat the
        smart kids!  I -- [trips]
         [unhappy] I bent my Wookie.
  Lisa: Hey Ralph, want to come with me and Alison to play "Anagrams"?

% muscle car with his fairly new girlfriend Marge.  He grins at the
% camera as Marge turns the hose on him, dousing him.  Homer has
% neglected to put the parking brake on in his car, it would seem: it
% rolls off the driveway and onto the street.
%
% In the next shot, it is Homer's birthday.  As Abe and Marge watch,
% bearded Homer opens Marge's present -- a book about beards.
% Delighted, he shows it to the camera, then leans forward to blow out
% the candles on his cake.  But his beard catches fire, and he runs back
% and forth in a panic while Marge worries and Abe laughs.

            [Bart watches a home movie of Homer's birthday]
      Bart: [laughs] They're going to eat this up at Show and Tell.
     Marge: I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the idea of your
            classmates laughing at our family's private moments.  How
            would you like it if, twenty years from now, people were
            laughing at things _you_ did?
      Bart: Not likely.  Come on, have a sense of humor about yourself!

% always trying to give me potatoes.  What is it with you?"  Marge
% explains, "I just think they're neat."  Bart runs up to Lisa's room.

Bart: I need something for Show and Tell.
Lisa: Just take one of my geodes.

Hibbert: Well, only one in two million people has what we call the "evil

% lifts, his entire upper body becomes huge and muscular.  He flexes a
% bit, proud, then walk over to Itchy menacingly.  Upon seeing him flex
% his biceps and chest, Itchy thinks for a moment, then smiles and pulls
% out a pink balloon and a pin.  He bursts the balloon, then pokes
% Scratchy in the chest, hoping for the same result, but all that
% happens is that a drop of blood leaks out.  Scratchy laughs evilly,
% but Itchy pokes many holes in his upper torso in rapid succession.
% This, too, seems to have no effect, and Scratchy laughs again, but as
% the blood leaks out from all the pinpricks, Scratchy feels weak and
% sits down on a bench to rest.  Itchy brandishes a chainsaw and slices
% off the cat's bicep and chest muscles.

% Bart and Lisa, as usual, laugh.  Itchy stops and turns to the camera.

   Itchy: Thanks, kids.  Now we'd like to speak to you seriously for a
          moment.
Scratchy: Yup.  This week is the grand opening of "Itchy and Scratchy
          Land" -- the violentest place on earth[tm].
   Itchy: And to celebrate, for this week only, we're cutting ticket
          prices in half.  [pulls out scissors]

% in turn with a mallet.  The ticket booths are large bombs with lit
% wicks.  At the booth the Simpsons are in front of, a sign announces
% the rides not working today: the Head Basher, the Blood Bath, the

Homer: One adult and four children.
Woman: Would you like to buy some Itchy and Scratchy Money?
Homer: What's that?
Woman: Well it's money that's made just for the park.  It works just

 Bart: Oh wow, cool!
 Lisa: Aw, cool!  That is neato.
Marge: Such a violent motif.
 Bart: Yeah, but it's just pretend violence, which is _actually_

 Bart: Ow!
Marge: Hmm...
Guard: [laughs] There's no need to murmur, ma'am.  Here at Itchy and

% runs a chainsaw.  Bart and Lisa smile as they watch.
%
% An Itchy and Scratchy robot pair walk next to each other and hit each
% other with mallets; blood even flies from their heads.  Another pair
% shoot each other repeatedly with short bursts from a machine gun.  The

% mind -- rather, they seem to be enjoying it.  "Wow," gasps Bart, "this
% is so much like my dreams, it's scary."  A steamroller driven by a man

        [baby ax runs to catch up with bigger axes]
Marge: It's cute, but I'm sure it's very sharp and probably dirty.
Guard: [walks up] [laughs] Dirty, mabye -- dangerous, hardly.  These are

% After the parade, the family enter the "Log Ride" which appears to
% have a steep, tall mountain as part of it.  They are seated in a log-
% shaped boat and metal handrails are locked in front of them as the
% ride begins.  "This is just what I hoping for -- spending the day
% together as a family --" Marge begins, but just then the log drops
% suddenly down a steep slope and everyone screams.  The log goes
% through a series of crossbows and cannons which fire and just miss
% them, stopping suddenly inches shy of long metal spikes placed
% strategically at eye-level.  But the horror doesn't have time to sink
% in as the boat falls down another steep slope straight towards a
% buzzsaw.  The boat is sliced in half (the family managing barely to
% avoid the same fate), and its members are dumped unceremoniously on a
% mat next to the river.  Bart and Lisa cheer happily.

Marge: You know, part of spending time together as a family is spending
       time apart as individuals.
Homer: Parents' Island?

Roger Meyers senior, the gentle genius behind Itchy and Scratchy, loved
and cared about almost all the peoples of the world.  And he, in turn,
was beloved by the world, except in 1938 when he was criticized for his
controversial cartoon, "Nazi Supermen Are Our Superiors".
-- The narrator tells "The Roger Meyers Story", "Itchy and Scratchy

% "Among his proudest achievements was the full-length musical
% `Scratchtasia'," continues the narrator.  A clip shows Scratchy
% dressed in a red robe wearing a blue hat with white stars trying to
% escape being chopped by Itchy with an ax.  Scratchy manages to wrest
% the ax from the mouse's grasp, then, glaring threateningly, he chases
% the mouse through a door.  In silhouette we see Scratchy chop the
% hapless Itchy into pieces.  Relieved, he walks back into the room, but
% the individual pieces of Itchy each turn into a miniature ax-wielding
% Itchy.  The troupe threaten Scratchy again, but he chops them all up
% and pounds them into a red pulp.  Exhausted, he pulls up a stool, sits
% down, and breathes deeply.  The fumes from the Itchy pulp enter his
% body and turn into microscopic Itchys that hack away at his insides.
% Scratchy grows old quickly, his skin wrinkling and turning grey, then
% crumbling from his body.
%
% Outside, at another robot parade, a yokel drawls, "Hey Moe, I'm gonna

% The scene opens with a shot of the KBBL radio building.

No sports, no rock, no information,
For mindless chatter, we're your station!
-- KBBL radio's jingle, "Sideshow Bob Roberts"

% The scene shifts to Homer eating donuts at the power plant.

Announcer: KBBL talk radio.  And now Springfield's favorite conservative
           and author of the well-selling book, "Only Turkeys Have Left
           Wings."  Ladies and gentlemen, Birch Barlow.
     Carl: Ecch!  That Barlow's a right-wing crackpot.  He said Ted
           Kennedy lacked integrity!  Can you believe that?
    Lenny: Yeah, switch the station.  I consider myself politically
           correct, and his views makes me [shivers] uncomfortable.
    Homer: Nonononono, guys...I'm not very political -- I usually think
           people who vote are a bit "fruity" [Lenny and Carl walk off]
           -- but for some reason this Birch Barlow really speaks to me.

-- Homer is awakened by construction, "Sideshow Bob Roberts"

% Maggie and her stuffed toys are bounced around in her crib to the

  Bob: So sorry, Mr. Simpson.  Your house is blocking construction of
       our new Matlock Expressway.
        [camera pulls back to show expressway looming overhead]
       Now, I am a fair man.  You will have 72 hours to vacate.  At that
       time we will blow up your house and any remaining Simpsons.
Marge: Homer, we've got to stop them!
Homer: I know what you're up to, Mayor Terwigiger.  And no one in my
       family's going to stand for it.

  Abe: Move your goldurn house, son!

Skinner: Bart, by special request of the Mayor's office, you are going
         to be left back.
   Bart: Oh.  You mean I have to repeat the fourth grade?

% At dinner, Homer laments the construction of the new highway.

Homer: We're going to lose our house and end up living under a bridge

 Lisa: I don't think Bob won that election legally.  I can't believe a
       convicted felon would get so many votes and another convicted
       felon would get so few.

% So Lisa heads off to the Springfield Hall of Records.

 Man: [carrying large stack of paper] Here you go: the results of last

Smithers: Well, you might as well give me a ride home now.
           [in the car]
          I've never gone behind Mr. Burns' back before but Sideshow
          Bob's ultra-conservative views, er, conflict with my...choice

       [pulls out list, looks at another tombstone]

Hutz: Mr. Mayor, is it true you rigged the election?
 Bob: No, I did not.
Hutz: [pause] Kids, help.
       [the judge shrugs]
 Bob: Oh, I don't mind.  We want these children to feel justice has been

      You know, Sideshow Bob, I believe you when you say you're
      innocent.
 Bob: Indeed I am.
Lisa: Because we all know you're a naive pawn -- puppet, if you will --
      of the most diabolical political genius Springfield has ever
      known: Birchibald T. Barlow!
       [Barlow stammers incoherently]
      You don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do

       Machiavellian art.
Judge: But why?
  Bob: Because you _need_ me, Springfield.  Your guilty conscience may
       force you to vote Democratic, but deep down inside you secretly
       long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize
       criminals, and rule you like a king.  That's why I did this: to

% At dinner Homer feels the need to comment on Lisa's hockey talent.

Homer: Lisa, if the Bible has taught us nothing else -- and it hasn't --
       it's that girls should stick to girls' sports, such as hot-oil
       wrestling, foxy boxing, and such-and-such.
Marge: I think women should be able to play any sport men play, but
       hockey is so violent and dangerous -- look at Milhouse's teeth.
        [open her hand]
 Bart: Mom, will you stop showing us those?
-- Marge's darker side, "Lisa on Ice"

    Lisa: I _have_ to join the team or I'll get an F that will haunt me

     Man: I now pronounce you President of these United --

           [crows gasps; Lisa is handcuffed]
     Man: In that case I sentence you to a lifetime of horror on Monster
          Island.  [to Lisa] Don't worry, it's just a name.
           [Lisa and others are chased by fire-breathing monsters]
    Lisa: He said it was just a name!
     Man: What he meant is that Monster Island is actually a peninsula.

% At the next hockey game, Homer walks into the dressing room with Lisa
% to lay down some rules.

Homer: OK, hotshots, now that my daughter is on your team, I want to
       make a few things clear.
 Lisa: [embarrassed] Please, Dad, I'll be fine
Homer: [makes negative mumbling noises at Lisa] I don't want anyone to
       give her a hard time just because she's different: no jokes, no

 Uter: [screams] Don't make me run, I'm full of chocolate!
-- Uter and the chocolate explosion, "Lisa on Ice"

% During the game, at first Lisa feels unsure of herself and afraid of
% the puck.  Rather than stopping the puck to help her team, she fends
% it off as though frightened, which accomplishes the same effect.

       [Homer and Bart laugh]
Marge: [covering her eyes] I can't even watch.  I don't know how you two
       can sit her laughing at poor Lisa while she's out there probably

Homer: OK, little buddy: hop in!

 Lisa: That's very nice, Dad, but it's wrong for you to reward violent

     Apu: We're having our best season ever.  And I would like to say

          It's all because of Lisa.
 Kearney: Let's hear it for Lisa!
           [Bart looks sullen]
Milhouse: Hey Bart, if Lisa's better than you at hockey, does that mean
          you're going to become better than her at school?
    Bart: [gasps] Maybe I will, Milhouse.  Maybe I will.
           [in class, Bart grins and puts up his hand]

  Abe: Well I hadn't thought _that_ far ahead.  [pause] Oh, OK, here it

Homer: But Marge, you deserve a vacation.  It's a chance for you to
       clean up after us in a whole other state!
Marge: I don't want to be a wet blanket, but getting on a plane like
       that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden.
Homer: Come on, Marge, I want to shake off the dust of this one-horse
       town.  I want to explore the world.  I want to watch TV in a
       different time zone.  I want to visit strange, exotic malls.  I'm
       sick of eating hoagies.  I want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long

 Lisa: Dad, I like picking beans with Gramma.

Homer: Keep sliding.
Marge: $30 will be fine.
Homer: Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa!  First, what are your qualifications?

Zweig: Kids can be so cruel.
Marge: But it's true.  They didn't write their own songs _or_ play their

% Back in the present...

Marge: [weeping] My father was a stewardess!
Zweig: Marge, there's nothing to be ashamed of here.  Today, male flight
       attendants or "stewards" are common.
Marge: They are?
Zweig: Yes, thanks to trailblazers like your father.  You might say he
       was a pioneer.
Marge: Yeah...you might even say he was an American hero.
Zweig: Let's not go nuts.
-- Too late, "Fear of Flying"

% Dr. Zweig concludes, "The important thing is that we've pinpointed the
% precise moment when you developed your fear of flying."  But Marge
% starts remembering some other stuff.  As a baby, she remembers her
% grandmother trying to feed her with a spoon, saying "Here comes the
% airplane" but taking a long time to put the spoon in baby's mouth.  As
% a young girl, a toy plane she was riding in caught fire.  Her mother
% takes her to a cornfield once, when a biplane swoops down and fires
% its machine guns at her.

Marge: Do you think those things could also have contributed to my fear
       of flying?
Zweig: [brusque] Yes, yes, it's all a rich tapestry.
Marge: Oh, well, thank you doctor.  You've changed my life!
Zweig: You know, Marge, we've really just begun to scratch the surface.
       There's still the far more serious problem of your husband.
Homer: [walking in] That's OK, you don't have to make her into some kind
       of superwoman.  She can get on a plane, that's plenty.  [rushes
       Marge out]
Marge: Thank you, doctor.  Whenever the wind whistles through the
       leaves, I'll think "Lowenstein", "Lowenstein".
Zweig: My name is Zweig.
Marge: [whispering] Lowenstein...

% The family finally get on a plane together.

Homer: Don't worry about a thing, honey.  I'm going to help you through
       this.

       Those are all normal noises.  Luggage compartment closing...cross

% The scene opens on the Stern Lecture Plumbing van ("I told you not to

% plumber stands in a foot of water in front of a leaky pipe.

Plumber: Looks like you got a leak.
  Marge: Could you start fixing it pretty soon?  The basement is getting

Plumber: Yeah, I probably won't be able to get the parts I need for two,

% Homer arrives at work quite late and pulls into the last available
% spot, right on the end of a row.  From the other side of a fence, Bart
% waves to him from his bedroom window: "Hi Dad!"  Homer makes
% dismissive noises and walks towards the power plant entrance.  As he
% gets close, Lenny and Carl pull up in their cars into parking spots
% right at the entrance.  "Hey," asks Homer suspiciously, "how come you
% guys got such great parking places?"  Lenny answers quietly, "It's a
% secret."  Carl tells him "Shh!  Shut up!"
%
% Homer walks to his station at work and sits on his chair, which
% promptly collapses.  He looks at the bottom of the stool, which reads
% "Econo-save budget stool: Factory Second".  "All right, Econo-save,
% you just made the list!"  Homer says menacingly, pulling out "Homer's
% Revenge List" and adding "Econo Save" to the end.
%
% He walks into the room where Carl and Lenny work and asks, "Hey!  Will
% you guys help me fix my -- " but stops when he sees them sitting in
% big, comfortable, vibrating chairs with their names on them.  "Hey...
% how come you guys got better chairs than me."  Lenny answers him
% again, "It's a secret!" and again Carl warns, "Shh!  Shut up!"

% At the soda machine, Lenny presses a ring with a special pattern onto
% it into a special place on the machine and gets a soda without paying

% asks the boys if they want to go bowling tonight.  "Naw, we're busy,"
% replies Lenny, and Carl adds, "Yeah, we got, er, things to do."  "Like
% what?" asks Homer, slyly.  "Uh, it's a secret," says Lenny for the
% third time.  Carl, in the middle of drinking, stops and eyes Lenny,
% leaving Homer to say, "Shut up!"
%
% At dinner, Homer tells the family about his day.

Homer: So anyway, Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays and they
       don't tell me where they go.  It's like a conspiracy.
 Bart: A conspiracy, eh?  You think they might be involved in the
       Kennedy assassination in some way?
Homer: I do...now.  Anyway, I'm going to follow them tonight and see
       where they go.
Marge: Oh, Homer, don't start stalking people again.  It's so _illegal_.
       Remember when you were stalking Charles Kuralt because you
       thought he dug up your garden?
Homer: Well, something did!
Marge: I don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
Homer: Oh, OK, have it your own way, Marge.  I'll be back in a minute

% The pair stop in front of a strange-looking building.  Homer's mouth
% opens wide in amazement.  Getting out, Lenny asserts, "There's our
% secret meeting place."  Carl agrees, "Yes.  Let's go inside."  "Sounds
% good," answers Lenny, and the two walk in.  A large man in a strange
% robe guards the door menacingly.  Homer walks up innocently, humming,
% and when the man blocks his entrance, he turns around quickly, still
% humming.

 Carl: We don't, uh, know what you're talking about, Homer.

       contain cholesterol, it has not yet been proven conclusively that
       they actually raise the level of serum cholesterol in the human

      Arnie: With the bridge gone and the airport unfortunately on the
             other side of the bridge, a number of citizens are
             attempting to jump the gorge with their cars.  It's a
             silent testament to the never-give-up and never-think-
             things-out spirit of our citizens.
       Kent: With our utter annihilation imminent, our federal
             government has snapped into action.  We go live now via
             satellite to the floor of the United States congress.
    Speaker: Then it is unanimous, we are going to approve the bill to

% can get out is raised.  Thinking quickly, he knocks it closed with

% without the loop it is nothing," cocking his gun again.
%
% He's spoken too quickly -- Krusty and Homer fly off the bar, straight
% towards the loop, and whizz around and around it many times.  They fly

         relations are at an all-time low.
          [talks over a slide show]
         As I'm sure you remember, in the late 1980s the US experienced
         a short-lived infatuation with Australian culture.  For some
         bizarre reason, the Aussies thought this would be a permanent
         thing.  Of course, it wasn't.

         What can we do for you?
Conover: Well, it's too late to merely pay back the money, but as a sign
         of good faith to our Australian friends, we'd like to imprison
         Bart for five years.
  Homer: [thinks briefly] That's tough but fair.  Boy, go with the man.
  Marge: [holds Bart to her] No, no, no!  No!  I'm not going to have my
         son go to jail over some silly tiff with Australia.  You'll
         just have to find some other country to have relations with.

  Homer: Er, I need another extension on my mortgage payments.
Manager: I understand that Mr. Simpson, but according to our computer,

         predeclined for every major credit card.  It also says that you
         once grabbed a dog by the hind legs and pushed him around like
         a vacuum cleaner.

Manager: Yeah, well, it all goes on your permanent record.  I'm sorry,

Marge: Homer!  Be careful of my sisters' heads: their necks are brittle.

   Bart: Look, Boris, I think ballet's for sissies.
Teacher: Ha ha ha!  Ballet is for the strong, the fierce, the

         [floors it]
Wiggum: Um, since you're trying to make a getaway in "park", I'm

        DMV; these two broads will help you out.  [shows a photo]
 Homer: Aah!  Aah!  Aah!  Aah!
Brooks: Wow.  Er, officer, this man is making me a little edgy.  Could

Marge: Tested, Homer!  God tested Moses.  And try to be nice to my

Chalmers: It's an unrelated article?
 Skinner: [nodding] Mm hmm.
Chalmers: Within the banner headline?
 Skinner: Yes.  [puts the newspaper down] Now, to redirect our
          conversation slightly, I had a few ideas on how to spend this

          Well, me and my fourth form chums think it would be quite

          plus the hotel on Baltic Avenue!
 Skinner: That hotel's a dump and your monopoly's pathetic.  This
          school's oil well is not for sale, particularly to a

   Burns: I see.  Then I'll just have to...attack you!

Marge: I'm happy for the school.  It sounds like this money's going to
       provide a lot of new opportunities.
 Bart: Big deal.  They didn't approve my idea; they said it was
       unfeasible.
 Lisa: It _is_ unfeasible to resurrect the dead, Bart.  And even if the
       Three Stooges _were_ alive I doubt they'd want to hang around
       with you.
 Bart: Oh yeah.  I guess they'd probably want to be with their families
       or something, huh?
Homer: Oh, I hate my job.  I mean, what's the point when your boss
       doesn't even remember your name?
Marge: I have an idea.
Homer: What?  What's your idea?
Marge: When my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent
       her a box of candy with his photo in it.  After that, she never
       forgot him.
Homer: That's all well and good, but it's not really _your_ idea, is it

          This isn't a rival company your battling with: it's a school.

Smithers: Now look, there's a photo in here.
   Burns: Ah yes, I believe that's little Maggie Simpson, the baby who
          found my precious teddy bear Bobo.  Oh, and that Simpson mutt,
          my former guard dog.  Oh and um, that's uh, Bart Simpson, he
          was my heir for a brief period, you know?
Smithers: Yes sir, I remember.

% survey the new superhero comic offerings.

Milhouse: The only decent new one is "Radiation Dude".
    Bart: Nah, he's just a cheap imitation of Radioactive Man.
Milhouse: [put out] Explain.
    Bart: The similarities are subtle, but many.  For example,
          Radioactive Man has his famous catch phrase, "Up and at 'em!"
          with "at 'em" spelled A-T-O-M in a delicious pun.
Milhouse: Go on...

% It's an evening at the Springfield Pops at Jebediah Springfield Park
% (sandwiched in between medfly sprayings).  Homer and Marge watch the
% orchestra from atop a hill on a blanket on the grass.

  Marge: Aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a
         little culture?
  Homer: Peh.  They're butchering the classics.  Could that bassoon have
         come in any more late?
  Marge: Aw, come on, Homer, there's lasers.  You like lasers...
  Homer: Laser effects, mirrored balls...John Williams must be rolling
         around in his grave.

% "We're out of here," proclaims Homer, dragging Marge along.
%
% They walk home through a seedy part of town.

Homer: Whoa, careful now.  These are dangerous streets for us upper-
       lower-middle class types, so avoid eye contact, watch your
       pocketbook, and suspect everyone.
Snake: Three-Card Monte.
Homer: Woo hoo!  Easy money!  [runs over]
Marge: Homer, these games are fixed.
Homer: Then how come that guy's winning?
  Man: [looks and sounds like Snake] Whoa, I, like, totally won again.
Snake: Way to go, bro!
-- Sincere viperine adulation, "The Springfield Connection"

% Marge cautions Homer, "He looks and acts just like the dealer.  I

Homer: Twenty on this one, my good man.  [puts a $20 dows]
Snake: [flips it] Sorry, my good man: black.
        [Marge turns the other two cards over; they're both black]
Marge: Homer, he cheated you!
        [spectators grumble angrily]
Snake: Surely you don't blame _me_!
Marge: It's people like _you_ who are ruining our downtown promenades

       this!

% "Buh-bye," calls Snake hastily, running off.  "Somebody stop him!"
% implores Marge, but everyone still stands and stares.  "He's getting
% away," she further pleads, "come on, come on!"  Seeing as no one wants
% to chase him, she runs after him herself.  "No, Marge!" calls Homer in
% pursuit, but he can't follow for long: his breath becomes too labored
% and he stops, panting painfully.
%
% Marge starts to gain on the multiply-convicted felon; seeing this, he
% turns down an alley, still pursued by Marge.  When he sees it's a dead
% end and that he's trapped, he turns around and flicks open a
% switchblade.  Marge gasps, "Uh, I must warn you, um...sometimes
% ordinary people [stammers] they get a surge of adrenaline."  He
% advances on her, and in a panic she smashes him in the face with a
% garbage can lid.  "See?" she scolds.
%
% Wiggum and some other policemen arrive on the scene.

Wiggum: Cuff him, boys.  We're putting this dirtbag away.
 Snake: Huh!  I'll be back on the street in 24 hours.
Wiggum: We'll try to make it twelve.
         [Homer arrives in a car, still panting]
 Homer: Marge, are you OK?
 Marge: Uh, I think I'm OK.  It was scary, but...in a weird way, it was
        also kind of exhilarating.
 Homer: Yes, it _is_ exhilarating to see the police get their man and
        save a hysterical woman.
 Marge: Oh, for crying out loud --

-- The many forms of excitement, "The Springfield Connection"

% Marge seems listless and bored at the supermarket.  "Strange," she
% says, picking up a can, "regular ham doesn't thrill me any more.
% Hmph."  Grabbing a different can, she asserts, "I'm crossing over to
% deviled ham!"  Then, when she thinks no one is looking, she pushes her
% cart really fast and stands on the front of it, whooping joyously at
% the speed.  She loses control of it as it hurtles toward a large hunk
% of cheese on display, jumping off just as the cart crashes into the
% cheese and becomes completely buried.  She walks away innocently.

% bottles: our ten favorite vintages").  Her eyes light up at this
% latter one when behind her, a few police cars skid to a halt in front
% of the police station, their sirens blaring.  A bunch of officers get
% out of their cars.

Wiggum: All right, get in there.
   Lou: You're going _down_.

 Marge: [knocking] Uh, excuse me?
Wiggum: What?  What?  What what what what what?  This better be about

 Marge: Uh, actually, I'm interested in becoming a police officer.

Wiggum: Welcome aboard.

% Homer can't believe his ears.

Homer: You did _what_?!
 Bart: I borrowed your nail clipper.  What's the big deal?
Homer: Nothing.  I'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she
       wants to be a cop.
 Bart: Cool!  Will you bring me along when you do evictions?
Marge: You got it, little buddy!
Homer: Marge, you being a cop makes you the man...which makes me the
       woman.  I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing
       the underwear (which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort
       thing).
Marge: Homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened.  You'll

% Marge reports to recruit training.

Wiggum: All right, you scrawny beanpoles: becoming a cop is _not_
        something that happens overnight.  It takes one solid weekend of
        training to get that badge.
   Man: Forget about the badge!  When do we get the freakin' guns?!
Wiggum: Hey, I told you, you don't get your gun until you tell me your

% Marge does the obstacle course, carrying concrete blocks up a hill,
% swinging on ropes, crawling under a fence, and struggling to climb
% over a tall brick wall.  "Women always seem to have trouble with the
% wall," observes Wiggum.  "They can't ever seem to find the door."
%
% On the shooting range, Marge walks through a town made of wooden house
% and building facades.  Various people (criminal and non-criminal
% alike) appear in windows, and Marge must shoot only the criminals and
% spare the non-criminals.  She achieves a perfect score, only Wiggum
% admonishes her afterwards: "You missed the baby, you missed the blind
% man..."
%
% The last test is a high-speed drive in a police car through traffic
% cones, over hills, and across an incomplete freeway.  As she skids to
% a halt at the finish, Wiggum says, "Oh, sorry, Simpson: you'll have to
% do the course again.  I was trying to get this, er, Magic Eye thing to

% Everyone else watches TV at home when Marge walks in.  "Hey,

 Bart: Wow, Mom, I never pictured you as any kind of authority figure

Homer: Marge, I want you to take care of yourself out there.  You've
       become very dear to me.
Marge: Oh, Homey, of course I will.
 Lisa: Mom, if someone shot at the mayor, would you have to throw
       yourself in front of him and take the bullet?
Marge: I suppose I would.
 Bart: What if they shot at a Coke machine?
Marge: No.
 Bart: TV?
Marge: No.
 Bart: TV with a picture of the mayor on it?
 Lisa: Whatever you do, Mom, we'll be proud of you.
Marge: Well thank you, honey.
 Lisa: As long as it's constitutional.

   Marge: $200.  [realizing] No, no!  I mean, nothing!  I don't take

Jebediah: People, our search is over!  On this site we shall build a new

          fields of hemp for making rope and blankets.
  Shelb.: Yes, _and_ marry our cousins.
Jebediah: I was -- what are you talking about, Shelbyville?  Why would
          we want to marry our cousins?
  Shelb.: Because they're so attractive.  I, I thought that was the
          whole point of this journey.
Jebediah: Absolutely not!
  Shelb.: I tell you, I won't live in a town that robs men of the right
          to marry their cousins.
Jebediah: Well, then, we'll form our own town.  Who will come and live a
          life devoted to chastity, abstinence, and a flavorless mush I
          call rootmarm?
           [the people divide between Jebediah and Shelbyville]
     Abe: The town of Springfield was born on that day, and to mark that

Milhouse: I really agree with you on this one, Bart.

      I don't got it.  Think, Bart.  _Where_ have you seen roman
      numerals before?  I know...Rocky V ["vee"]!  That was the fifth
      one.  So, Rocky five plus Rocky two equals...Rocky VII!  "Adrian's
      Revenge"!
-- Bart reasons his way out of the tiger lair, "Lemon of Troy"

% And not a minute too soon.  The other kids burst in just as Bart
% escapes through door VII and locks it shut behind him.  "Oh, it's no
% use," he moans walking away, "I'm _never_ going to find that tree.
% This whole raid was as useless as that yellow lemon-shaped rock over
% there.  Wait a minute...there's a lemon behind that rock!"  He picks
% it up and looks up: "The tree!"  Except its base is inside the
% Shelbyville Car Impound Lot.

% The gang of Springfield children assemble on a hilltop overlooking the
% impound lot.  The Shelbyville children ride around it on motorbikes
% while the Springfield kids look through binoculars at it.

  Martin: Aw, a car impound lot: the impenetrable fortress of suburbia!
Milhouse: We'll never get the tree back now.
    Bart: Keep your voices down, boys: we didn't come this far to get
          found out.
   Homer: [parting the bushes] Found 'em!  You kids are in _big_
          trouble, running away from home like this!
    Bart: But they stole our lemon tree.
   Homer: I don't care what excuse you've got.  _Nothing's_ going to

          tree?!
-- Nothing except the hallowed lemon tree, "Lemon of Troy"

% Homer goes down to the impound lot gates to argue with Shelby's
% father.

 Homer: That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our
        forefathers.  Give it back or we'll bust in there and take it!
Homer2: Bust in here and take it?  You must be stupider than you look.
 Homer: Stupider like a fox!
         [tries to climb the fence; fails]
         [panting] I'm OK.
         [tries again; fails again]
Homer2: [chuckles] Don't you get it, Springfield?  It's over.  You lose!
        Now if you'll excuse me, all this talk has made me hungry.
         [bites into a lemon; his face contorts at the bitterness]
-- So much for his teeth enamel, "Lemon of Troy"

% On the ride back, everyone is disappointed.

Homer: This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield.  If
       anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower.
 Bart: There's got to be a way to get that tree back...hey, look!  A
       hospital.  Pull in there!  [yanks the wheel]
Homer: Aah!  Oh, great, now I'm upside down.
-- Damn RV showers, "Lemon of Troy"

% Homer2 rides along later and sees the RV parked in the hospital zone.
% "Some thoughtless human being has parked in a hospital zone!" he says,
% driving his toe truck over and hitching the RV to it.  He drives the
% RV into the impound lot, shuts the gate on it, and parks his toe truck
% at home.
%
% Later that night, some shadows creep out of the RV.  "Hee hee hee, no
% one in history has ever done anything _this_ clever," chuckles a
% shadow that sounds like Homer.  They strap the tree to the roof of the
% RV.  "I'll get the gate," says Bart, but as soon as he opens it, an
% alarm goes off.  A ferocious dog runs after Bart, growling.  Homer
% assures Bart he'll take care of it, throwing the dog a steak.  It
% leaps in the air, catches it, and continues after Bart.  "Faster, son!
% He's got a taste for meat now!"  Bart jumps into the RV just in time
% as the dog's snout deforms the metal.

Homer2: Get out here, son.  There's a doin's a-transpiring!  Let's shut
        the gate and seal them in!
  Bart: Gun it, Flanders!
   Ned: It won't start.  Something's draining the battery.
 Homer: [using the oven] Sorry.
-- We eat first, then escape later, "Lemon of Troy"

% They drive toward the rapidly closing gate, barely scraping their way

    Homer2: Ooh, you lousy Springfielders, you -- shake harder, boy!
-- That'll learn 'em, "Lemon of Troy"

% As the RV drives through the gate to Springfield, the tree catches on
% the archway and falls off.  They have to back up to get it.

     Abe: And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of
          Springfield.  They had brought the sacred tree back to its
          native soil, and though Flanders was stuck with the impound
          fee, he could easily afford it.
Milhouse: More lemonade, Bart?
    Bart: Absolutely.
           [Milhouse squeezes a tiny bit of juice in a glass]
Milhouse: [pouring sugar in] Say when.
     Abe: There are over fourteen parts of the lemon which are edible...
    Abe2: And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of
          Shelbyville.  They had banished the awful lemon tree forever,
          because it was haunted.  Now let's all celebrate with a cool
          glass of turnip juice.

  Bart: _You_ made a movie?
Barney: _I_ made a movie?  No wonder I was on the cover of
        "Entertainment Weekly".
-- Barney's short-term memory, "A Star is Burns"

% Barney's movie is in black and white.  It opens with a shot of a Duff
% beer bottle on a windowsill.  Gauzy white curtains billow around it as
% the love theme from "M.  Butterfly" plays.  A hand grabs the bottle
% and turns it upside down; the camera pans slowly down to reveal
% Barney's lips on the other end of it.
%
% The next shot shows Barney from above lying on a couch under the
% window.  As a voiceover, he says, "My name is Barney Gumbel.  I'm 40,
% I'm single, and I drink."  The scene fades to a road where Barney lies
% in the gutter, drinking another Duff, then lying down.  The Duff pours
% slowly into a sewer grating.  "There's a line in `Othello' about a
% drinker: `Now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
% beast.'  That pretty well covers it."  The camera shows a time lapse
% view of clouds moving during the day, which turns to night, then back
% to day again.  Barney has become an old man, bald, toothless, still
% lying in the same gutter.  A tear leaks from his eye.
%
% A woman watching the movie is moved.

 Woman: It's brilliant: savagely honest, tender...he has the soul of a
        poet.
Barney: You're very kind.
 Woman: Excuse me, did something crawl down your throat and die?
Barney: It didn't die!
-- Methinks the man doth protest too much, "A Star is Burns"

% Back on the screen, Barney sits in a chair and says, "My name is
% Barney Gumbel, and I'm an alcoholic."  The camera pulls back to reveal
% several similarly-attired girls.  Lisa says, "Mr. Gumbel, this is a
% Girl Scout meeting."  Barney asks, "Is it?  Or is it that you girls
% can't admit you have a problem?"
%
% The scene fades to a playing record player, then back to Barney on the
% couch, a rose held to his nose.  "Don't cry for me," he narrates, "I'm
% already dead."  He puts the rose in the Duff bottle on the windowsill;
% its petals fall off slowly, and the curtain billows in front of it as
% "Fin" appears.
%
% Everyone applauds wildly; Marge blows her nose.  "I think we have a
% winner," says Jay.  Homer walks in holding a beer and asks, "What'd I
% miss?"  Marge chides him, "Homer, please pay attention!  There's just
% one more movie."  That movie is "A Burns for All Seasons", starring
% Montgomery Burns as Montgomery Burns, Bumblebee Man, and Tommy Tune as
% "Smithers".  The title sequence features the picture from the Sistene
% Chapel of God touching Adam's finger, except instead of Adam, it's
% Burns.  A long list of writers scrolls by, ending with Lowell Burns
% and Babaloo Smithers.
%
% The first scene opens with Mr. Burns atop a horse wearing a sombrero,
% rounds of machine gun ammunition draped across his chest.  "Simple
% villagers," he says to a group of people, "I promise you I will close
% plants in America and bring work here!"  Chespirito cries, "Viva Senor
% Burns!" and the assembled villagers cry, "Viva!  Viva!"  Burns' horse
% gallops off, but Burns doesn't manage to stay in the saddle, instead
% getting dragged back and forth along the ground.  In the audience,
% Burns laments, "We did twenty takes, and _that_ was the best one."
%
% The next scene features Mr. Burns saying, "Remember, Elliot, I'll be
% right here," on one knee to a child.  The tip of his finger lights up
% briefly; he then enters a spaceship, its door spiraling closed, which
% takes off into the crimson sky.  The audience murmurs angrily among
% themselves, "Pure egotism!  Self-indulgent tripe," and the like.  "I
% don't care what they say," vows Burns, "I'm going to win this
% festival!"
%
% The next scene shows a Roman centurion on a horse leading a group of
% shackled prisoners across the desert.  The last prisoner, who bears a
% striking resemblance to Charlton Heston, collapses from exhaustion.  A
% shadow appears over him: a man kneels in front of him, strokes his
% hair, and hands him a bottle of spring water.  "Drink up, Judah Ben
% Hur," exhorts Mr. Burns.  Ben Hur does so, then looks up gratefully
% and says, "You truly are the king of kings."  A heavenly light shines
% down upon Burns, and he says "Excellent."  The movie ends.

Audience: Boo!  Boo!
   Burns: Smithers...are they booing me?
Smithers: Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns!  Boo-urns!"
   Burns: Are you saying "boo" or "Boo-urns"?
Audience: Boo!  Boo!
    Hans: I was saying "Boo-urns"...

 Marge: Second.
Quimby: Well, I vote for Burns' movie.
Krusty: Me too.  Now let's get going.  I've got a date with Eudora
        Welty.  [a huge burp can be heard] Coming, Eudora!
         [a miniature camera hidden in an olive whirs]
 Burns: [watching] Excellent.  Bribing those two judges had paid off,

  Jay: Well, we're not going to resolve this deadlock any time soon.
Marge: Why don't we all take a five minute break?  It'll clear our

% Marge rues her decision to put Homer on the judging committee.

 Marge: I knew this would happen.  I put you on the jury and you vote

 Homer: I have every right to be on that jury, even though I got there
        because I'm sleeping with the head of the festival.
   Jay: How many times have I heard Rex Reed say _that_?
 Homer: Oh, great, now _you're_ going to make fun of me!
   Jay: No, Homer, I won't make fun of you.  But I will suggest there

        groin with a football.

% Homer watches Barney's movie again to make his final decision.

 Homer: [thinking] Hmm...Barney's movie had heart, but "Football in the

Barney: [on the screen] Don't cry for me, I'm already dead.
 Homer: Wow.  I'll never drink another beer.
   Man: Beer here!
 Homer: I'll take ten.

% The audience reassembles for the final announcement.  Jay announces,
% "And now to announce the winner.  The award for outstanding animated
% short goes to...Itchy and Scratchy for their film, `Four Funerals and
% a Wedding'."  Scratchy stands with his bride in front of a priest when
% Itchy runs on and abducts her.  He replaces her with a similar-looking
% bride made entirely of bombs and dynamite, their fuses burning.
% Scratchy kisses her blithely, wipes her mouth blithely, then lives the
% rest of his life blithely, producing children that are also made of
% bombs and dynamite.  In his old age, he sits with his bride in an old
% folks' home when she finally explodes, turning he and his rocking
% chair into charred skeletons.  A bearded Itchy walks up to point and
% laugh, but the exertion gives him a heart attack and he keels over.
% The audience, of course, laughs.

        envelope] Barney Gumbel!
Barney: What?  Wow!
 Burns: [shudders]
 Marge: Homey, you voted for the right movie.  I'm glad you were on the
        jury.  [kisses him]
 Homer: Aw.  You know something, Marge?  It's not that tough being a
        film cricket.
Barney: [at the podium] I've learned I have a gift to share with the
        world.  From now on, there'll be a new Barnard Gumbel:

Krusty: [laughs, then sighs] Oh...
  Bart: [watching] I'm surprised he doesn't try to blame his problems on
        his Percodan addiction.
Krusty: It wasn't my fault, it was the Percodan.  If you ask me, that

 Bart: Who?
Owner: I am not at liberty to divulge the party, but they were most

> Quotes and Scene Summary
===============================================================================
Troy: "The Simpsons" began as the brainchild of cartoonist Matt
      Groening,
       [screen shows a bald man with an eyepatch saluting in front of a
      US flag and looking menacing]
      the already-famous creator of such comics as "Damnation", "Johnny
      Reb", and "True Murder Stories".  [screen shows each]
      In 1987, Groening teamed up with award-winning producers James L.
      Brooks
       [shot of 8F01-esque rich man surrounded by bags of money]
      and Sam Simon.
       [shot of Howard Hughes-esque naked man typing in bed]
      And what better place to premiere their creation than on "The
      Tracy Ullman Show", the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes
      and musical comedy numbers?  On April 19th, 1987, America first
      met "The Simpsons".

Announcer: In the opening credits, what does the cash register say when

           The cash register says, "NRA4EVER", just one of the hundreds
           of radical right-wing messages inserted into every show by
           creator Matt Groening.
     Troy: Over the six years "The Simpsons" has been on the air, we've
